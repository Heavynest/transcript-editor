00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.010
Wait,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.970
wait,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.720
wait.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.810
I think it's physically 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.240
waste with 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:56.570
wade 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.710
check 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.530
just 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.350
flocking in.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.430
Okay,

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.870
we will get started again.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.210
Fire one of these.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.340
Thanks for your patients.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.510
Are you guys ready to be spoken?

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.840
Well of complete the introduction,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.650
they can talk a bit.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.170
Is there figure out the technology.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.310
So welcome back.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.700
Thanks for being back on time for the break.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.990
Sorry,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.090
we had a little thing happening.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.120
Ran a little bit over,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.230
but we're having it back on track.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.860
So the next presentation,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.810
we're shifting back to the echo through sixty team a topic that i'm sure is near and dear to 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.550
everyone's heart here,

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.600
which is about cloud usage and reporting those topics together,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.180
i think are certainly one of the if not the topic about which we get the most 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.400
questions or people wanna have the most conversations on dh.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.118
That was true even yesterday and last evening and this morning in various conversations that i've had.

00:02:04.408 --> 00:02:05.528
So i think it's very timely.

00:02:06.178 --> 00:02:07.818
So by popular demand,

00:02:07.818 --> 00:02:09.598
we're gonna bring up tony a body again.

00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:10.888
He'll be part of the conversation,

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:14.048
but i'm sure the heavy lifting will be done by at least gordon who's,

00:02:14.048 --> 00:02:15.398
our corporate development manager.

00:02:16.488 --> 00:02:21.238
You may know alise if we've done in kind of detailed pricing or 

00:02:21.248 --> 00:02:22.478
usage analytics.

00:02:22.938 --> 00:02:27.548
Least at least does a lot of that work behind the scenes and so she's the perfect person also 

00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:32.738
have been tapped recently to be kind of product manager for reporting analytics within the product,

00:02:32.748 --> 00:02:35.988
so she has lived the job and very qualified to do that,

00:02:36.538 --> 00:02:37.788
so if we're ready to go there,

00:02:37.788 --> 00:02:38.988
then i will turn it over to the team.

00:02:40.558 --> 00:02:41.248
Thank you,

00:02:41.258 --> 00:02:41.718
chris.

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:42.078
All right,

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:42.278
well,

00:02:42.278 --> 00:02:47.208
we're just gonna jump right in i may or may not have a clicker so sorry five toe keep coming back here,

00:02:47.238 --> 00:02:52.108
but ultimately i wantto first start by going over our overall 

00:02:52.108 --> 00:02:56.558
reporting strategy and really what we want to do at the cores provide high level 

00:02:56.558 --> 00:03:01.348
reports for dean's admin is instructors provos and hopefully 

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:06.328
soon advisers as well and really what we want to be doing here is exposing the power of 

00:03:06.328 --> 00:03:11.318
this platform through all of this pedagogic lee compelling data that we have so at 

00:03:11.318 --> 00:03:16.088
this point it's about getting all of this wonderful data that we have into your hands and so that's 

00:03:16.088 --> 00:03:20.348
been our focus in the recent months and will be moving forward.

00:03:22.438 --> 00:03:22.728
Also,

00:03:22.728 --> 00:03:24.358
i want to talk about how far we've come,

00:03:24.358 --> 00:03:29.018
so i think last year around this time we were talking about debut ing the admin 

00:03:29.018 --> 00:03:33.528
dashboard and in that time we've not only debuted the admin 

00:03:33.528 --> 00:03:34.078
dashboard,

00:03:34.078 --> 00:03:38.818
but we've also doubled the number of cards on that dashboard so increasing the amount of 

00:03:38.828 --> 00:03:43.608
data that you guys all have access to these cards now open up 

00:03:43.608 --> 00:03:45.828
two tables of data in some cases,

00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:47.478
charts and other cases,

00:03:47.838 --> 00:03:49.908
and we are also as of today,

00:03:50.778 --> 00:03:53.008
providing the ability to see us fee export,

00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:57.638
some of that data and that's going to continue to improve as we move forward so gay huge 

00:03:57.638 --> 00:03:58.098
deal,

00:03:58.728 --> 00:04:00.908
go explore the admin dashboard,

00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:01.798
play around with it,

00:04:01.798 --> 00:04:03.309
see what it has to offer.

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:04.139
Um,

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:08.579
another big thing that we've done is we've re architected our data infrastructure.

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:08.749
Now,

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:12.179
this was a really big deal for multiple reasons,

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:15.869
but most notably it's going to improve the accuracy of our data,

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:17.099
which is a huge deal,

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.979
and it's also going to allow us to it'll write more quickly and produce these reports and get those 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.259
out to you in a much more timely manner.

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.799
We've also added the ability to filter all of this data by organization department,

00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:32.149
so we'll give you a better idea,

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:37.369
thie ability to drill down and see who's doing what in the platform and all of 

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:42.019
this is really moving us tour closer and closer to this calpers data feed that we 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:46.889
ultimately want to provide this will allow you to get a live feed of data 

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:52.069
into your data warehouse or wherever you're you're able to collect that and so this 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:55.779
is when you can really do all of the analysis all your data junkies,

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.029
this is what we're moving towards for you.

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:00.579
So,

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:05.409
like i had highlighted the admin dashboard is probably one of the biggest things we've done in reporting in the past 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:05.749
year,

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:07.459
so if you have access to this,

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.859
go in,

00:05:07.859 --> 00:05:08.579
check it out,

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:13.429
you'll notice here all the cards that we have available right now we're going to continue to add 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:14.919
to this dashboard,

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.509
so this is exciting it's going toe become even more robust,

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:19.509
you can go in there,

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.369
you khun add remove cards that you don't want to see,

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:23.199
you move them around,

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.089
you can customize this view to make it look the way you like.

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:30.159
Um and then,

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:30.709
like i said,

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:33.009
today is just an overview of what we're talking about.

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:35.719
Clouds usage is going to be a big topic of conversation.

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.489
We're also going to talk about what reports we've recently released,

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:43.689
and then we're also going to talk about upcoming reporting that's where i'm going to want to get some of your feedback,

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:44.939
so stay tuned.

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.639
So in terms of cloud,

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.349
you said you want to talk about a few things,

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:52.199
first of all,

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.779
i want to talk about uh,

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.189
why's cloud usage for a lot of people higher than initially anticipated,

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:03.959
we talk about what activities air actually generating this cloud usage and how you can figure that out through your 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:08.248
admin dashboard um also weaken through this admin dashboard figure out which 

00:06:08.258 --> 00:06:11.738
organizations and departments are actually generating your cloud usage.

00:06:12.248 --> 00:06:13.438
And lastly,

00:06:13.438 --> 00:06:16.548
and probably the thing on a lot of people's minds is,

00:06:16.808 --> 00:06:17.638
is this cost?

00:06:17.638 --> 00:06:19.478
This is rising cloud usage.

00:06:19.488 --> 00:06:19.988
Um,

00:06:20.458 --> 00:06:22.658
are these figures going to be manageable?

00:06:26.028 --> 00:06:27.568
So if we take a look at this chart here,

00:06:27.568 --> 00:06:29.568
this is going to help us address the question.

00:06:29.578 --> 00:06:34.038
The question of wise are the cloud you such numbers so much higher than maybe we ever could have 

00:06:34.038 --> 00:06:34.788
anticipated?

00:06:35.218 --> 00:06:35.708
Well,

00:06:35.838 --> 00:06:38.998
we'll notice here is this orange bars showing for mea?

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:43.678
These are all the stats and it's the average number of student 

00:06:43.688 --> 00:06:45.458
interactions in a given month.

00:06:46.198 --> 00:06:49.278
The orange bar is showing what happened on eco system,

00:06:49.288 --> 00:06:54.048
so this is showing that on average students would interact with the system about four times per 

00:06:54.048 --> 00:06:54.448
month.

00:06:55.198 --> 00:07:00.198
You'll notice that the figure when they go over to echo three sixty and the instructor does nothing different than what 

00:07:00.198 --> 00:07:03.318
they did before goes up over three times,

00:07:03.518 --> 00:07:07.788
so you'll notice that students engage more with the platform it's driving more usage 

00:07:08.048 --> 00:07:12.748
on dso that's part of the reason why we see these usage numbers higher but the important thing to 

00:07:12.748 --> 00:07:16.558
emphasize here is that's a huge jump in 

00:07:16.798 --> 00:07:20.518
interactions that means they're using the platform or right,

00:07:20.518 --> 00:07:22.148
that should be a really good thing.

00:07:22.588 --> 00:07:27.548
So we want to get away from thinking about why the rise in usage is a bad thing and 

00:07:27.548 --> 00:07:29.618
start thinking about why it's really a good thing,

00:07:29.628 --> 00:07:30.028
right?

00:07:30.508 --> 00:07:31.128
Um,

00:07:31.378 --> 00:07:32.058
so that's,

00:07:32.058 --> 00:07:32.538
what we're going to,

00:07:32.548 --> 00:07:32.878
you know,

00:07:32.878 --> 00:07:37.818
try and focus on today and some of the some of the 

00:07:37.828 --> 00:07:39.378
pricing that we've put in place,

00:07:39.488 --> 00:07:41.238
we'll help you guys manage this cost,

00:07:41.448 --> 00:07:43.548
the last thing we ever want to hear is,

00:07:43.698 --> 00:07:45.028
how can i cut them off?

00:07:45.038 --> 00:07:46.908
How can i throttle the usage back?

00:07:46.918 --> 00:07:48.358
I can't pay for this,

00:07:48.358 --> 00:07:49.448
we'd never want to hear that,

00:07:49.458 --> 00:07:49.718
right?

00:07:49.718 --> 00:07:51.878
So we're gonna we are going to address that today.

00:07:55.118 --> 00:07:59.638
So like i talked about in the admin dashboard there's this beautiful clouds,

00:07:59.638 --> 00:08:03.418
you said shorten it allows you to see which activities are generating your usage,

00:08:03.418 --> 00:08:06.828
so you'll notice that right now there are four different colors,

00:08:07.621 --> 00:08:10.411
two of them deal with video on demand streaming.

00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:15.621
This is probably the largest portion of cloud usage for most customers there's another one 

00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:20.351
with with live streaming and then another bucket for other well notices,

00:08:20.351 --> 00:08:23.911
the blue bar moving forward in the months since january,

00:08:23.921 --> 00:08:28.921
is that the biggest portion of the chart the reason being this is all of the 

00:08:28.921 --> 00:08:33.291
video on demand streaming that we can actually a tribute to an organization or department 

00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:39.181
the reason why it was mostly orange prior to then is because that's everything that we could 

00:08:39.181 --> 00:08:44.071
not a tribute to an organisation department but it's still on demand streaming that is being 

00:08:44.071 --> 00:08:48.851
tied to that institution so we've provided that granularity from january 

00:08:48.851 --> 00:08:53.311
moving forward which again is why you see so much of that blue bar um we will 

00:08:53.311 --> 00:08:58.191
continue to get ah increasingly granular with how we break this out 

00:08:58.191 --> 00:09:03.171
so we would like to be able to show you usage from mobile viewing you usage from downloads 

00:09:03.281 --> 00:09:06.251
so we will continue teo to improve this chart,

00:09:08.801 --> 00:09:13.681
i'd also mentioned that you can now drill down and see usage at the organization department 

00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:18.541
level so you'll notice on your admin dashboard you're able to toggle and filter 

00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:23.411
by organization or department depending on what you'd like to look at on dh when you when you 

00:09:23.411 --> 00:09:28.311
click on the organ for example that you'd like to view your 

00:09:28.311 --> 00:09:33.111
cloud usage char is going to filter for specifically the cloud usage tied to 

00:09:33.111 --> 00:09:37.901
that organization so this is a way for you to again figure out alright who's 

00:09:37.901 --> 00:09:42.771
contributing to these higher numbers and ultimately we would like to provide this in a 

00:09:42.771 --> 00:09:47.531
csp export to you so you don't have toe necessarily toggle through and memorize all the 

00:09:47.531 --> 00:09:52.141
numbers for example okay how do you manage the 

00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:52.691
costs?

00:09:52.831 --> 00:09:53.221
Well,

00:09:53.231 --> 00:09:55.411
we have multiple solutions for you.

00:09:56.001 --> 00:09:56.801
First of all,

00:09:56.801 --> 00:10:01.681
we are always improving our variable pricing model and that's it where we 

00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:02.501
have the license,

00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:07.021
plus the cloud usage bundles that you purchase allah card as you need them,

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:11.014
and we're constantly making those cloud usage bundles more affordable.

00:10:11.014 --> 00:10:15.454
This is as we as we get savings from amazon as we improve our cost 

00:10:15.454 --> 00:10:20.204
structure were obviously passing those savings on to you so just know that that's always improving 

00:10:20.544 --> 00:10:25.034
and then for our customers who have more extreme use cases for example,

00:10:25.034 --> 00:10:27.084
the opt out model that we discussed earlier,

00:10:27.384 --> 00:10:30.634
we do have the option to do a capped pricing model,

00:10:30.634 --> 00:10:32.054
so this will give well,

00:10:32.054 --> 00:10:33.934
this will provide more price certainties,

00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:38.664
so you pay one price at the beginning of the year on dh it's for the 

00:10:38.664 --> 00:10:39.324
most part,

00:10:39.324 --> 00:10:41.814
you're not going to exceed the cloud usage that we give you,

00:10:41.814 --> 00:10:46.694
so this tends to be a much more cost effective option for customers like i 

00:10:46.694 --> 00:10:47.024
said,

00:10:47.024 --> 00:10:51.704
who they just go off the wall there used all the students on their license 

00:10:52.334 --> 00:10:56.784
are maxed out there in that opt out model and capturing very heavily 

00:10:59.044 --> 00:11:03.944
so here's an example of a customer who it would make sense for them to move to an opt 

00:11:03.944 --> 00:11:08.494
out model are sorry a capped model and i'll explain why so you'll notice the active 

00:11:08.494 --> 00:11:13.474
students number that they have for the years about ten thousand that was the same as 

00:11:13.474 --> 00:11:18.334
their license you'll notice that their implied capture intensity was 

00:11:18.334 --> 00:11:23.204
about twenty five percent so what this means is they were currently in an opt in model 

00:11:23.494 --> 00:11:28.344
so if a student took four classes in a term we were they would record one out of 

00:11:28.344 --> 00:11:33.314
four of those classes you'll notice that the students on average reviewing about 

00:11:33.314 --> 00:11:38.064
ten videos per month and this equated to about five hundred thousand cloud 

00:11:38.074 --> 00:11:42.734
usage hours so in the variable model that they were in they would be 

00:11:42.734 --> 00:11:44.084
paying you know,

00:11:44.084 --> 00:11:48.964
somewhere north of ten pounds per student uh which in and of itself isn't 

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:53.974
shocking but the problem is that costs could rise right?

00:11:53.974 --> 00:11:58.774
So what you'll notice is in the second column over here you'll see that 

00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:03.784
if they were to go to an opt out model where instead of recording one out of four 

00:12:03.784 --> 00:12:08.514
of the classes the student was taking they were recording three out of four of those classes 

00:12:09.022 --> 00:12:13.952
you'll notice that that uh those clouds usage hours go from around five 

00:12:13.952 --> 00:12:18.662
hundred thousand to almost one point eight million that is a scary number when you're on a 

00:12:18.662 --> 00:12:19.722
variable model right?

00:12:19.752 --> 00:12:24.652
Because it could keep growing you just you don't know what's going to stop it so what 

00:12:24.652 --> 00:12:29.592
we proposed was something that was slightly north of what they were paying 

00:12:30.262 --> 00:12:30.582
um,

00:12:30.582 --> 00:12:32.902
on the variable model at the lower use case,

00:12:33.042 --> 00:12:35.902
but it was still going to it was going to give them price certainty.

00:12:35.902 --> 00:12:38.182
They know that they're not going to go to let's,

00:12:38.182 --> 00:12:38.552
say,

00:12:38.862 --> 00:12:40.122
thirty pounds per student,

00:12:40.182 --> 00:12:40.902
for example.

00:12:41.082 --> 00:12:44.352
So this really makes sense when a there's ah,

00:12:44.362 --> 00:12:47.942
larger license you have a lot of students on and b,

00:12:48.182 --> 00:12:50.502
you're going to a much more intense capture model,

00:12:50.502 --> 00:12:55.352
so we know we have a lot of customers who are thinking about going from opt in to opt out.

00:12:55.522 --> 00:13:00.432
They have twenty thousand students who they assume are going to be using the product that's when it 

00:13:00.432 --> 00:13:03.002
makes sense to look at something like this.

00:13:03.312 --> 00:13:05.792
So if you have questions about this,

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:08.182
we can always talk about it later,

00:13:10.552 --> 00:13:13.502
so now i want to turn to the recently released reports.

00:13:13.502 --> 00:13:18.362
So we have three big reports that have been released in the admin dashboard in the 

00:13:18.362 --> 00:13:19.262
past couple months.

00:13:19.262 --> 00:13:21.932
So first one is the capture sources card.

00:13:22.222 --> 00:13:24.472
The second is the audit trail report,

00:13:24.482 --> 00:13:26.252
and the third is top section,

00:13:26.252 --> 00:13:28.052
so i'll go into detail on all three.

00:13:30.952 --> 00:13:31.272
All right,

00:13:31.272 --> 00:13:32.472
so what we've shown here,

00:13:32.472 --> 00:13:32.742
these air,

00:13:32.742 --> 00:13:35.572
just screen shots of the captures capture sources,

00:13:35.582 --> 00:13:38.662
the first one is the car that you see on the admin dashboard.

00:13:38.812 --> 00:13:42.012
The second is the motile that'll pop up when you click on that card,

00:13:42.012 --> 00:13:46.662
so definitely go into the stash boarding click around because you will see different things when you,

00:13:46.702 --> 00:13:47.792
when you click on the cards,

00:13:47.862 --> 00:13:48.252
basically,

00:13:48.252 --> 00:13:53.012
what this shows here is it's just a breakdown of the different types of devices that you're 

00:13:53.012 --> 00:13:57.152
using to do your captures and the amount of captures that air coming from each,

00:13:57.152 --> 00:14:00.642
so you'll be able to see how many are from pro devices,

00:14:00.652 --> 00:14:01.312
chd,

00:14:01.312 --> 00:14:01.922
devices,

00:14:01.922 --> 00:14:02.992
pod devices,

00:14:03.622 --> 00:14:05.332
p caps he kept etcetera,

00:14:05.332 --> 00:14:09.852
so you'll really be able to see how the institution is using the various 

00:14:10.918 --> 00:14:12.198
avenues for capturing,

00:14:12.368 --> 00:14:15.198
and then you'll also be able to filter by organization and department,

00:14:15.198 --> 00:14:16.558
which is nice because you can see,

00:14:16.558 --> 00:14:17.358
for example,

00:14:17.548 --> 00:14:21.558
the biology department on lee uses software to capture what,

00:14:21.558 --> 00:14:22.308
while,

00:14:22.608 --> 00:14:22.828
you know,

00:14:22.828 --> 00:14:26.688
different department only uses hardware so that maybe something you're interested in,

00:14:26.818 --> 00:14:31.818
and this report will allow you to see that the audit trail 

00:14:31.818 --> 00:14:34.408
report is a little bit newer than the capture sources card.

00:14:34.848 --> 00:14:39.378
With this shows you is a list of the changes that have happened in the 

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:40.038
platform,

00:14:40.308 --> 00:14:42.108
andi will be all from the day before.

00:14:42.108 --> 00:14:45.168
I think this updates daily in the middle of the night,

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:46.198
um,

00:14:46.198 --> 00:14:48.178
so you'll have the card shown here,

00:14:48.328 --> 00:14:49.438
and then when you click in,

00:14:49.438 --> 00:14:54.128
you'll have this table that you can filter the date range so you can see certain 

00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:56.138
changes that have been made for example,

00:14:56.138 --> 00:15:00.738
if you want to see over the past week you'll be able to do that this shows things like 

00:15:00.748 --> 00:15:05.268
students added deleted courses section same you know,

00:15:05.398 --> 00:15:09.398
any any time you're adding or deleting uh things in the system so 

00:15:12.608 --> 00:15:17.238
and then the top sections card is probably the biggest report that we've 

00:15:17.248 --> 00:15:21.788
gotten out recently and it's a big deal we've had the card on the dashboard for a bit,

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:26.848
but only recently could you actually click into this card and see this wonderful table of 

00:15:26.848 --> 00:15:27.678
data inside?

00:15:27.678 --> 00:15:32.528
So what the top sections card is showing and i believe tony alluded to it in his presentation 

00:15:32.538 --> 00:15:36.698
earlier but you'll be able to see the top three sections across the 

00:15:36.698 --> 00:15:41.148
institution based on most engagement per student.

00:15:41.208 --> 00:15:42.818
And so when we talk about engagement,

00:15:42.928 --> 00:15:45.548
we mean everything from video viewing,

00:15:45.558 --> 00:15:46.698
slide deck viewing,

00:15:46.838 --> 00:15:51.148
polling responses notify notes taken um content marked 

00:15:51.158 --> 00:15:51.978
confusing,

00:15:52.578 --> 00:15:57.508
so what we're doing is we're aggregating the counts of all of those activities and dividing by the number 

00:15:57.508 --> 00:16:01.738
of active students in that section for the for the current term.

00:16:02.488 --> 00:16:06.968
So there's a ghost in here 

00:16:07.998 --> 00:16:08.638
all right,

00:16:08.648 --> 00:16:12.662
we're back wasn't special system this table is 

00:16:17.122 --> 00:16:21.172
someone playing a trick on me he's got the clicker 

00:16:22.432 --> 00:16:25.892
question was is this at top sections are all section one 

00:16:27.272 --> 00:16:27.572
yeah,

00:16:27.582 --> 00:16:28.142
absolutely.

00:16:28.142 --> 00:16:32.802
So this is this will give you all sections that are in the system so we're 

00:16:32.802 --> 00:16:37.712
ranking it by top sections in descending order from most engagement toe least but 

00:16:37.712 --> 00:16:40.022
we can also have zero engagement,

00:16:40.022 --> 00:16:43.902
which means there are sections that are 

00:16:44.942 --> 00:16:49.812
they may not be doing any activity and so you will be able to see that from this report and you can 

00:16:49.812 --> 00:16:54.622
just sort to figure out which sections those are so you can sort all of these columns 

00:16:54.832 --> 00:16:57.282
you can now filter all of these columns,

00:16:57.282 --> 00:17:02.032
so if you want to look a data for a specific instructor so you want to see maybe how one 

00:17:02.032 --> 00:17:06.912
instructor teaches across multiple sections you'd be able to see that in this table here 

00:17:07.592 --> 00:17:12.412
and today you can now see s v export all of this data so 

00:17:12.562 --> 00:17:17.412
this should give you this is probably the most granular report that we have provided in c s v 

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:20.302
export form in the product at this point.

00:17:20.442 --> 00:17:24.702
So this is a this is a really great report definitely go check this out.

00:17:27.832 --> 00:17:32.502
All right now i want to talk about upcoming reporting it so this is where i'm going to need some of your input at the end 

00:17:32.502 --> 00:17:37.492
here i want to talk about two reports that we are currently working on and then we'll talk about what else 

00:17:37.502 --> 00:17:41.202
is is on the docket too to debut 

00:17:43.072 --> 00:17:47.992
so the first one here is a video asset report this would be very similar to the 

00:17:47.992 --> 00:17:52.802
top sections report in it's in the way looks and feels so you would have a card on the 

00:17:52.802 --> 00:17:57.752
admin dashboard you'd be able to click on that card and it would take you too a table that looks 

00:17:57.752 --> 00:18:02.592
very similar to the layout of the top sections report this would show you each 

00:18:02.592 --> 00:18:07.562
row would be a different video asset that you have in this in the system and 

00:18:07.562 --> 00:18:11.847
then you would have stats corresponding to those assets such as when was it 

00:18:11.847 --> 00:18:12.617
created?

00:18:12.617 --> 00:18:13.947
When was it last viewed?

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:19.017
How many students have viewed the video you'd be able to see 

00:18:19.027 --> 00:18:23.717
the video duration on average how long two students viewed the video do they view it for five 

00:18:23.717 --> 00:18:28.587
minutes do they view for fifteen minutes and then ideally what we'd be able to do 

00:18:28.587 --> 00:18:33.507
is well is give you the ability to drill down into each asset on 

00:18:33.507 --> 00:18:38.477
the same table and you'd be able to see each user's view you be able to see who 

00:18:38.477 --> 00:18:43.467
they were when they viewed it how they viewed it did they view from a mobile device did they view from a 

00:18:43.467 --> 00:18:46.217
tablet on and then how long did they view it?

00:18:46.477 --> 00:18:51.217
Did they view it for five minutes ten minutes fifteen minutes so this would be a very granular 

00:18:51.217 --> 00:18:54.887
report they would again have the ability to see us fee export 

00:18:58.757 --> 00:19:02.107
we are also working on some improvements to the instructor dashboard,

00:19:02.247 --> 00:19:07.167
so one of the biggest reasons why we're choosing to do this now is we ultimately want to 

00:19:07.167 --> 00:19:12.047
get all of this data in the instructor dashboard away from our old data 

00:19:12.047 --> 00:19:14.037
infrastructure and on to the new,

00:19:14.257 --> 00:19:14.997
more accurate,

00:19:14.997 --> 00:19:16.217
more efficient platform.

00:19:16.277 --> 00:19:17.857
So that's,

00:19:17.867 --> 00:19:22.817
why a lot of this work is being done now and what we're going to be doing is on 

00:19:22.817 --> 00:19:27.687
the current students tab we're going to provide the same late 

00:19:27.687 --> 00:19:32.407
table layout that's in the top sections report we're gonna use that table in the student's 

00:19:32.407 --> 00:19:37.327
tab provide a bit more data for the instructor and we're going to allow them 

00:19:37.327 --> 00:19:40.577
to see us one click csp export right from that page,

00:19:40.577 --> 00:19:45.207
so that should be a lot more convenient to the instructor they don't have to go dig around and 

00:19:45.487 --> 00:19:49.017
do multiple things to export it should be very straightforward for them,

00:19:52.057 --> 00:19:56.807
and then we're also going to do a little bit of re design to the to the classes tab 

00:19:56.997 --> 00:20:01.807
so currently on the classes tab you have a line chart on dh there's 

00:20:01.807 --> 00:20:04.837
really no raw data underneath to support it,

00:20:04.837 --> 00:20:09.347
so what we're going to be doing is actually providing the data in a bar charts,

00:20:09.347 --> 00:20:14.155
you'll be able to see all of the different engagement activities that have happened for each 

00:20:14.155 --> 00:20:19.115
lesson that the instructor has taught over the term and then below that we'll have 

00:20:19.115 --> 00:20:23.865
a table with all of the raw data that is feeding that that table so to be 

00:20:23.865 --> 00:20:27.295
really easy way for the instructor traction get the raw data that they're seeing,

00:20:27.465 --> 00:20:30.005
and again that will be a one click csp export.

00:20:34.185 --> 00:20:38.885
So i also want to talk about some of the upcoming reports that that will be will come after 

00:20:38.885 --> 00:20:39.545
those two.

00:20:40.195 --> 00:20:44.145
So the first one is the idea of an advisory services dashboard,

00:20:44.445 --> 00:20:47.765
so this would be very similar to the existing admin dashboard,

00:20:47.765 --> 00:20:50.175
but it would be for a different role in the institution,

00:20:50.525 --> 00:20:54.865
and we provide things like at risk students of 

00:20:54.925 --> 00:20:59.875
reports so you'd be able to see you know which students haven't locked into the system in x number 

00:20:59.875 --> 00:21:04.345
of days maybe who has the fewest number of engagement activities relative to their 

00:21:04.605 --> 00:21:05.825
peers in the same class?

00:21:05.825 --> 00:21:09.825
Perhaps so we're definitely looking to do something like that,

00:21:09.825 --> 00:21:10.995
so if you have input,

00:21:11.345 --> 00:21:14.165
if you have colleagues who would have a lot of input on that,

00:21:14.345 --> 00:21:16.295
we definitely want to get your feedback.

00:21:17.285 --> 00:21:21.815
We also plan to add that csg export feature that you now see on the top 

00:21:21.815 --> 00:21:25.165
sections report to all the other cards in the admin dashboard,

00:21:25.165 --> 00:21:28.435
so we be providing that for things like cloud usage,

00:21:28.435 --> 00:21:30.995
as i mentioned on the student activities card,

00:21:30.995 --> 00:21:35.895
so definitely be working on that over the coming months and then we also 

00:21:35.895 --> 00:21:39.035
want to create a unique students report,

00:21:39.045 --> 00:21:43.765
so this would allow you to see how many unique students have been active in the 

00:21:43.765 --> 00:21:48.635
system over the license period over the past academic year,

00:21:48.895 --> 00:21:52.445
and then we're hoping that some really cool data comes out of that,

00:21:52.445 --> 00:21:54.725
where you can actually see year over year,

00:21:54.725 --> 00:21:56.885
a significant rise in unique students,

00:21:56.885 --> 00:22:00.725
and we've done some analysis with this data outside the platform,

00:22:00.725 --> 00:22:04.865
and it is really powerful to be able to see the jump in students year over year,

00:22:04.865 --> 00:22:05.675
when you're growing,

00:22:07.145 --> 00:22:11.345
we'll also be making sure that we provide that important licensing data in the platforms,

00:22:11.345 --> 00:22:12.135
you'll be able to see,

00:22:12.135 --> 00:22:13.015
for example,

00:22:13.355 --> 00:22:18.255
the number of cloud usage hours used versus purchase the number of active students 

00:22:18.435 --> 00:22:21.375
in the system versus what is allowed on the license.

00:22:21.517 --> 00:22:23.617
So we'll be priding all that data to you.

00:22:24.287 --> 00:22:24.687
Uh,

00:22:24.697 --> 00:22:29.467
we would also like to do a live streaming reports he'll be able to see very similar to the 

00:22:29.467 --> 00:22:30.607
video asset report.

00:22:30.797 --> 00:22:33.827
You'll be able to see the statistics on your life streams,

00:22:34.717 --> 00:22:39.597
and then the last one we want to do is this cross institution benchmarking,

00:22:39.597 --> 00:22:42.947
so obviously the other institutions would be anonymous eyes,

00:22:42.957 --> 00:22:45.877
but you would be able to see on various engagements,

00:22:45.877 --> 00:22:46.347
stats,

00:22:46.757 --> 00:22:49.067
how you compare to other institutions,

00:22:49.067 --> 00:22:53.827
so just kind of get an idea of where where i fit right you may think that you're not doing 

00:22:54.037 --> 00:22:58.967
nearly enough engagement you find out that you're one of the top performers so that'll just be an 

00:22:58.967 --> 00:23:03.487
interesting way tio to gauge where you stand so like i said,

00:23:03.487 --> 00:23:08.267
i'm gonna need your help now so if everyone can everyone who's logged in at least 

00:23:08.277 --> 00:23:13.067
can answer this pole we would love to get your feedback on what you'd like to 

00:23:13.067 --> 00:23:17.757
see next so i've provided based on our list 

00:23:17.767 --> 00:23:22.697
of reports what we i think we're going to do next but if you have something 

00:23:22.697 --> 00:23:27.547

feedback is really important so i'll leave this open for a little bit 

00:24:01.227 --> 00:24:01.617

Okay so for everyone who put other make sure that you actually provide provide 

00:24:11.797 --> 00:24:12.427

00:24:28.952 --> 00:24:33.692
thread that's that's fine just started q and a yeah

there are also a lot of great suggestions have been allies awesome good 

00:24:46.092 --> 00:24:51.002
like i said given our new data infrastructure we can go a lot more 

00:24:51.002 --> 00:24:55.072
quickly on these reports now so definitely send your feedback and well,

00:24:55.082 --> 00:24:56.102

All right.

00:25:09.902 --> 00:25:10.622
Uh,

00:25:11.142 --> 00:25:11.512
okay.

00:25:11.692 --> 00:25:12.642
I'm gonna close it out.

00:25:13.612 --> 00:25:14.332
Almost there.

00:25:14.332 --> 00:25:15.262
Any objections?

00:25:19.492 --> 00:25:19.692
All right.

00:25:19.702 --> 00:25:20.122
Awesome.

00:25:20.122 --> 00:25:20.272
Well,

00:25:20.272 --> 00:25:23.502
thank you guys for your participation and your patients today.

00:25:23.502 --> 00:25:24.982
So i appreciate it.

00:25:25.402 --> 00:25:27.322
And i look forward to all of your feedback.

00:25:27.632 --> 00:25:31.442
Hopefully come to the birds of the feather table session and we can talk more 

00:25:32.912 --> 00:25:35.572
thing.

00:25:35.842 --> 00:25:36.162
Alright,

00:25:36.172 --> 00:25:36.832
thanks very much.

00:25:36.832 --> 00:25:37.112
At least.

00:25:37.122 --> 00:25:41.962
I think given that there have been so many questions put in and it's really detailed and were fifteen minutes 

00:25:41.962 --> 00:25:42.792
behind schedule,

00:25:43.182 --> 00:25:44.882
i'm going to probably skip over specific.

00:25:44.882 --> 00:25:48.852
Q and a on this particular topic can keep moving if that's okay,

00:25:48.852 --> 00:25:53.522
unless anybody has anything just absolutely critically urgent and relevant to the whole group.

00:25:53.642 --> 00:25:55.252
So we're going through the q and a,

00:25:55.302 --> 00:25:55.482
right?

00:25:55.542 --> 00:25:55.872
Yeah,

00:25:55.872 --> 00:26:00.792
i see that it reaches the right person to talk about all things driver.

00:26:03.512 --> 00:26:03.922
Okay,

00:26:06.052 --> 00:26:06.362
okay,

00:26:06.372 --> 00:26:11.182
so we'll move along and we're going to jump back to the customer side now and have another 

00:26:11.182 --> 00:26:12.322
customer presentation,

00:26:12.782 --> 00:26:14.342
this one again from our friends at king's.

00:26:12.782 --> 00:26:14.342
