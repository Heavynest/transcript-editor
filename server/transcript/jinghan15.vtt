WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.930
And he's going to take you through a reasonably

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.880
on the universal capture capabilities so you've heard us speak about that quite a bit and

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.680
tony's the man that's been the leader of that effort and so it will be exciting to have

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.110
you have a chance to do that well he's getting set up how many people have signed up for the beta

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.430
program for universal capture what on lee all right,

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.260
well you're not no you're not getting out here till more people agree to sign up sze that uh

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.040
yes okay we'll have him answer that question yeah if you

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.970
how many people didn't know about the beta program okay how many people want to

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.540
be in the band program about art in the burger okay so we'll fix that today teo

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.450
have you decided it was that fool is just for my anus yes the first first

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.240
releases for magadan yeah and they'll be windows later so

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.430
but your your true if you're not a mac shop you can't use debating um

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.600
okay great what's what or what's windows is that nerd

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.600
well this is getting a serious presentation in many

00:01:17.610 --> 00:02:04.420
ways

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.410
people enough to slice me kind of why i forgive you but no i just

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.250
made it okay consider that

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.300
all right good afternoon everybody in the interest of time being so late in the day and is

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.260
on the last session i will do my best to go

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.200
as quickly as well

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.790
just get jokes so i just want to start off by

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.280
saying how excited i am to share with you echo three sixty universal capture

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.560
on dh just for those of you who wanna wear it universal capture is on next

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.580
generation off classroom and personal capture

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.320
and actually before i get into it i am going to demo the mech divisional of universal

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.060
capture i will say that i'm using an internal development version ofthe

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.010
capture of so it's slightly different from the version we actually making available two customers like yourselves

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.460
if fell developers play a cruel joke on me they may push updates during this

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.260
presentation so with that in mind i have us

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.820
i have ass you know that's for us,

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.090
right?

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.820
Bill somebody would dance for assistant case to distract you all also if you didn't

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.740
knows uh tony had not uploaded slides until just now they're couples so if you looked and you thought there were

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.790
any they're actually a couple there.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.670
Now if you want to follow up and already a couple of comments so before actually starting off

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.540
with and giving you some background on universal capture i do want to cover the state ofthe capture today

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.980
is that exists with,

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.800
uh echo echo three sixty so for those of you aware,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.100
i would assure me you uh you know that we support both mac

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.630
pc classroom personal uh,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.970
web based and even device based capture,

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.470
which is great on these are fairly robust systems,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.250
but truth be told,

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.260
some of these legacy applications are a little bit long in the tooth.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.530
And as tony allude itude two this morning,

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.710
they each have their own code base.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.840
So you you probably are aware of the fact that hell

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.990
things function on a pc may not function the same on a mac

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.620
or the things that you can do on a pc.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.580
You may not be able to do on on the web if you're doing an ad hoc capture.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.150
So we we really wanted to address us,

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.220
and we had two options,

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.600
and thankfully,

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.420
with the support of bill and cris and toni and the rest of the executive team,

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.810
they gave us the opportunity to update our capture systems.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.140
And so we sit out last year when we had we did some of that internal analysis

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.770
look through the logs took all of our previous experience,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.010
looked at a ll the reviews and feedback that we got from customers and we came up with really to pas

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.830
that we could have taken first is we could continue to both on to those existing legacy

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.470
applications and do our best to provide you with all the features of functionality that you wanted

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.670
or two.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.200
We could go in a completely new direction,

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.550
and it probably doesn't come as a surprise that we decided to go in a completely new direction and there's a

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.480
lot of good reasons for it,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.400
and i want to share with you four of those goals that we came up with this part of this new direction,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.220
so the first goal was easel views um,

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.840
i can tell you from my own experience of working in academia and based on my discussions with

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.650
instructors and administrators alike,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.160
what they didn't want was a solution that requires an instructor in particular to have

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.220
to read the manual.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.710
We'll get some sort of training on how to do a lecture capture,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.510
okay,

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.350
so we wanted to make the solution is simple and easy as possible,

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.240
so that was gold number one goal number two is we wanted to make

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.760
sure this is super reliable.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.860
Last year we did an update to our capture engine for a classroom capture solution,

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.960
and it used to be that if a device in and put the vice wass unplugs

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.900
accidentally or even on purpose or audio was missing or whatever the case may be

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.410
in the capture would fail.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.730
So we made an update last year and we set that as our base line that effin input device

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.570
was removed for water for whatever reason we would continue to capture,

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.037
so that was our baseline third we wanted

00:06:30.037 --> 00:06:34.557
to make sure that there was consistency so whether or not you're doing a captured through the browser

00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:39.757
or capture on a mac or capture on a pc whatever form of capture that you're

00:06:39.757 --> 00:06:44.347
doing we wanted to make a consistent throughout all of those different

00:06:44.917 --> 00:06:49.407
avenues and wanted to make it again so so

00:06:50.107 --> 00:06:54.947
if you were to do training for instructors in particular that's one time training and it doesn't matter

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:59.747
which option they use they can expect to see the exact same uh

00:06:59.757 --> 00:07:04.637
workflow and experience and fourth we wanted to build a solution that was

00:07:04.637 --> 00:07:09.267
smarter and what i really mean by this is again alluding to what tony mentioned to us this morning

00:07:09.647 --> 00:07:14.627
rather than having a ll these different code bases and all these different approaches to coming up with a solution

00:07:15.127 --> 00:07:19.547
we have a single code base that allows us to put out

00:07:19.547 --> 00:07:24.487
functionality quicker more effectively which is great for you and great for

00:07:24.487 --> 00:07:25.737
us as well ok,

00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:31.257
so those who are full primary goals that we came up with this we started and backing on this new

00:07:31.257 --> 00:07:36.067
universal capture road path let me just go the

00:07:36.067 --> 00:07:40.977
you i really quickly so it's a cz some of you are probably aware right now without

00:07:40.977 --> 00:07:45.867
legacy solutions we'll provide you with a little stamp size preview off the

00:07:45.867 --> 00:07:50.537
imports that are going on so what we've endeavored to do now is actually blow up those previews

00:07:50.797 --> 00:07:53.427
as biggest possible just make it easier on the engines.

00:07:53.427 --> 00:07:53.747
All right?

00:07:54.797 --> 00:07:59.467
We've removed all the optional features from the

00:07:59.467 --> 00:08:04.447
actual u y so even though this looks for those you have for those of you who

00:08:04.447 --> 00:08:05.397
haven't seen this before,

00:08:05.627 --> 00:08:10.157
this look starkly different from other solution because there's now less options

00:08:10.937 --> 00:08:14.547
okay less options on the main screen we're just tucked them away okay?

00:08:14.547 --> 00:08:19.417
Because our optional we support one touch recording and

00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:22.977
instructor can literally walk into the room if there was no scheduled capture,

00:08:23.507 --> 00:08:25.577
push that button and away they go,

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.220
then they can leave the classroom afterwards.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.420
That's simple one touch recording so again looking for ease and simplicity

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:38.230
to select and changing of the input devices we have two menus here you can have

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:43.130
display over there on the left the right size doesn't matter trying to provide you

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.890
with a little bit of flexibility in some options there same with the audio input

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.090
to select from the from the menu and if you have multiple options available,

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.710
pick one and away you go so try to make a simple is possible.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.870
Um,

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.930
we have timers here and you can see that's set to zero because it's not actually recording right

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:06.880
now but that's just a visual to oran indicated to an instructor or an jesu that nothing is actually

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.840
happening right now you're not in you're not actually recording when a

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.750
recording is actually going on then the view changes just slightly so we locked

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.500
down the screen and now we just give you the textural feedback off the

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:26.480
input devices that have been captured and then rather than a record

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:31.440
now we just have a finish and a pause button really simple okay,

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.330
trying to make it as easy as possible for in jesus um you can see we have the

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:41.260
visual indicator over the amount of time that has actually possible then capture this is an hour

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.420
long recording and in this case it's eleven seconds into it.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:45.670
Okay,

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:50.630
so just getting started right now we have two core controls the middle one hears

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:55.550
this pause everybody should probably familiar with that and then to the left of it

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.690
we haven't finish.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.410
Okay,

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:02.750
finish um there's a lot of options that we actually

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:03.950
support with an echo and i listen,

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.720
the more that i know i'm not going to go into each one of them,

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:11.080
but i am going to show you and emma some of these to you uh,

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:15.920
we actually as part of the baker beta program right now we're really doing our best to get

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.910
feedback from injuries is like yourself and so we have some poles that are

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.110
currently available now feedback,

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.570
form and honor on the active lonely platform and where we want to be able to

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.030
support your use cases,

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:33.755
your needs what have you so i do have a pole for your and whether or not regardless of

00:10:33.755 --> 00:10:35.755
whether you are an administrator or not,

00:10:36.055 --> 00:10:37.655
i would like to get your feedback on this.

00:10:38.225 --> 00:10:41.525
So the pole is specifically doesn't show so well here,

00:10:41.845 --> 00:10:45.795
but there's a cross button that's disabled right now.

00:10:46.275 --> 00:10:46.655
Okay,

00:10:47.005 --> 00:10:51.965
so i want to get your feedback on that cross on these two questions here and i'll go explain and give you a little bit of

00:10:51.965 --> 00:10:52.735
context here.

00:10:53.825 --> 00:10:57.635
So we have gotten some feedback from administrators and instructors.

00:10:57.895 --> 00:11:02.505
Sometimes administrators get frustrated with instructive where the setup a scheduled

00:11:02.505 --> 00:11:04.255
capture an instructor.

00:11:04.255 --> 00:11:05.395
For whatever reason,

00:11:05.675 --> 00:11:08.355
you purposefully purposely all by mistake,

00:11:08.815 --> 00:11:10.185
they have cancelled that capture.

00:11:10.585 --> 00:11:13.105
So it's a missed opportunity right for students.

00:11:13.735 --> 00:11:18.525
So this first option here is about whether or not you

00:11:18.525 --> 00:11:21.175
want the option to enable,

00:11:21.745 --> 00:11:26.705
provide the ability to enable or disable the canceling off a

00:11:26.705 --> 00:11:28.975
scheduled capture off for instructors.

00:11:30.525 --> 00:11:32.345
So as administrators do you want there?

00:11:32.345 --> 00:11:33.075
Toggle option.

00:11:34.985 --> 00:11:35.815
Just take a minute,

00:11:35.815 --> 00:11:37.535
get your thoughts and feedback on that.

00:11:54.635 --> 00:11:55.245
Okay,

00:11:55.255 --> 00:11:55.425
let's,

00:11:55.425 --> 00:11:56.225
take a look.

00:11:58.095 --> 00:11:58.415
All right?

00:11:58.985 --> 00:11:59.465
Yes.

00:11:59.475 --> 00:12:04.425
So we we can enable administrators whether or not you want to enable instructed

00:12:04.425 --> 00:12:06.215
us to cancel a capture,

00:12:06.715 --> 00:12:07.625
so that's that's,

00:12:07.635 --> 00:12:08.415
pol number one,

00:12:08.755 --> 00:12:12.815
the second one is very much related to this so assuming you we give you that that,

00:12:12.825 --> 00:12:16.425
um that ability there's been a lot of discussion off.

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:16.675
Well,

00:12:16.675 --> 00:12:20.475
how long do we want to give instructors the ability to cancel a capture?

00:12:20.975 --> 00:12:21.135
You know,

00:12:21.135 --> 00:12:25.765
two minutes into a lecture but probably not going to be looking at the screen or the or the recording

00:12:26.235 --> 00:12:31.075
so we can disable it after after that time maybe we need to give you a little bit more time a

00:12:31.075 --> 00:12:35.504
little bit more flexibility so we'll give you five minutes before we

00:12:35.504 --> 00:12:39.564
disabled the cancel option option for instructors

00:12:40.144 --> 00:12:45.144
or option number c option c is we can always leave it

00:12:45.144 --> 00:12:45.444
on.

00:12:45.914 --> 00:12:50.844
So what that implies is and instruct that can come in and either cancel a

00:12:50.844 --> 00:12:55.554
scheduled capture within the first minute or if it's an hour long capture

00:12:55.864 --> 00:12:59.424
it can cancel a fifty nine minutes into that lecture

00:13:00.794 --> 00:13:04.544
just keep in mind once it's cancelled it's gone there's no retrieving it.

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:05.514
Okay,

00:13:05.514 --> 00:13:09.594
so three options there give you a minute see what you think

00:13:15.004 --> 00:13:19.694
sorry don't allow him to

00:13:19.704 --> 00:13:24.604
cancel so as the administrator your toggle would be we will be to keep it disabled

00:13:25.334 --> 00:13:30.244
they cannot cancel it first we could just you could just look at this not giving you options

00:13:32.714 --> 00:13:37.674
so this option is you have given the option for the instructed to cancel it how long do you

00:13:37.674 --> 00:13:39.924
want to give him two minutes five minutes indefinitely

00:13:47.944 --> 00:13:48.304
okay,

00:13:48.604 --> 00:13:51.334
so roughly five minutes and you is an administrator.

00:13:51.334 --> 00:13:55.894
You can enable the option for instructors to cancel a scheduled classroom

00:13:56.034 --> 00:13:56.494
capture.

00:13:57.534 --> 00:13:57.864
Perfect.

00:13:57.864 --> 00:13:58.414
Thank you very much.

00:13:58.414 --> 00:13:59.274
We can certainly do that.

00:14:00.334 --> 00:14:00.854
Um,

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:04.654
before actually get into the roadmap.

00:14:05.574 --> 00:14:06.814
Let me see if we can do a demo.

00:14:07.604 --> 00:14:12.494
So have a camera here facing towards the

00:14:12.494 --> 00:14:13.044
front.

00:14:13.864 --> 00:14:14.954
I'm gonna switch over.

00:14:15.914 --> 00:14:20.294
What you see here is firefox safari and the desktop application.

00:14:21.524 --> 00:14:23.174
This is part of universal capture.

00:14:23.594 --> 00:14:26.534
Want to show you how everything works in ports in unison.

00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:29.464
So i have the flexibility i'm not recording right now.

00:14:29.464 --> 00:14:30.544
You see my view you're meeting,

00:14:30.624 --> 00:14:33.174
jumping up and down the flexibility.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.170
Maybe i want to show display,

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:36.810
see how they all work in tandem.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:37.950
That's,

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:38.860
universal capture.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:43.510
Maybe i want to keep the two videos to video inputs.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.720
So?

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.060
So come on,

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:50.960
hd camera here.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.980
Camera facing that way i could do to to desktop imports if i want so a little bit of

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:56.510
flexibility,

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:56.750
right?

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:57.950
I'm gonna,

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.590
uh,

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:01.590
show me to do one more show.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:05.630
You one more thing here on my phone actually have universal capture.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.200
We'll see if this works.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:13.010
Hopefully hasn't time doubt change the input goes back to

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:17.330
nothing think about the possibilities that are there

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.560
now i'm not so sure about instructors but i'm going to show you in a minute.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:23.570
For administrators,

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:28.460
what this means in particular is that we can untether you from your office or your

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.000
desk,

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.360
and you could be anywhere in the world at any time and preview exactly what's

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:34.860
going on,

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:35.450
okay,

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.980
that's all part of confidence wanted on your smartphone on your tablet,

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.460
on the computer,

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.080
wherever all you need is a connection,

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.060
lifestream is an option with scheduled capture.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:57.680
We are looking tio have a little bit more on this case,

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:02.230
so i have the option of controlling all this from here.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.720
One might go and start a recording,

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.210
so five second countdown has instructed a little bit of time to prepare and get ready for capture

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:10.950
and were often running.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:16.120
Now this one you've seen this mrs here because it's being roughly fifteen minutes and after

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:16.750
fifteen minutes,

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.060
we stopped polling the server,

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.640
so we're not constantly berating your service,

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:21.270
okay,

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.230
so probably in a few minutes just to do the same,

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.230
but i'm going to close down the browsers,

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.220
safari,

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:31.880
it's,

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.940
five bucks,

00:16:36.172 --> 00:16:36.852
so here.

00:16:37.292 --> 00:16:40.882
So i want to demonstrate a keyboard navigation,

00:16:40.892 --> 00:16:42.922
so we want to be able to support accessibility.

00:16:43.172 --> 00:16:46.852
Even though i've started a capture and have locked down most of the controls,

00:16:47.072 --> 00:16:48.762
there are still a few options of elephants.

00:16:48.812 --> 00:16:53.762
Available to me as an instructor or end user so i can tap through here and i

00:16:53.762 --> 00:16:54.862
can extend the time,

00:16:55.212 --> 00:16:59.712
so using my keyboard or even my mouse and click on this and this is actually a

00:16:59.712 --> 00:17:00.822
smart timer.

00:17:01.132 --> 00:17:06.042
So if there's another capture that scheduled after this this l a long session

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:11.222
let's just say there's a fifteen minute break this will only allow me to add five minutes,

00:17:11.232 --> 00:17:12.082
ten minutes,

00:17:12.422 --> 00:17:13.822
maybe fifteen months,

00:17:14.842 --> 00:17:19.642
but won't allow me to add thirty minutes that it won't be an option so that's a smart ability to

00:17:19.652 --> 00:17:24.132
add additional time to capture and then again using people navigation i can

00:17:25.292 --> 00:17:30.142
i can't pause visual indicate a visual cue to the to the

00:17:30.142 --> 00:17:30.712
ngos that,

00:17:31.052 --> 00:17:31.262
hey,

00:17:31.262 --> 00:17:32.002
this is paused,

00:17:32.512 --> 00:17:35.122
but notice this still counting down?

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:36.862
Why is that?

00:17:38.032 --> 00:17:42.862
Because i'm eating a part of my hour long time available to me

00:17:43.122 --> 00:17:45.132
to actually capture right nothing's going on?

00:17:45.142 --> 00:17:46.342
You can see this is paused,

00:17:47.252 --> 00:17:49.042
but i'm still taking a part of my hour long.

00:17:49.212 --> 00:17:53.372
So visual cues for the instructor of the andes heir they may or may not see thatjust,

00:17:53.382 --> 00:17:58.202
but just want to make sure you're aware and then to resume again keyboard navigation

00:17:59.882 --> 00:18:04.702
i'm back in business right when i'm

00:18:04.702 --> 00:18:05.192
done,

00:18:06.742 --> 00:18:09.032
if this is a schedule capture in particular,

00:18:09.032 --> 00:18:10.052
or even an ad hoc capture,

00:18:10.052 --> 00:18:15.022
for that matter um you have the option of where you want to publish this to so at the end of

00:18:15.022 --> 00:18:19.672
the cellar i could walk out of the classroom and i will know with certainty there's going to either be published

00:18:19.672 --> 00:18:24.522
to my library by default or a section if it

00:18:24.522 --> 00:18:29.292
has been scheduled that way or if i've chosen to publish it to a section is part of that whole capturing

00:18:30.062 --> 00:18:33.212
okay to finish,

00:18:33.672 --> 00:18:37.492
i just want we just want to make sure hey,

00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:38.782
you've got an hour available.

00:18:38.782 --> 00:18:40.462
Are you sure you want to finish now?

00:18:40.712 --> 00:18:44.182
There's fifty seven minutes and twenty six seconds remaining again?

00:18:44.182 --> 00:18:48.912
Just that visual feedback that visual cue for your end users so that they understand and no

00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:51.192
repercussions of exactly what's going on,

00:18:51.622 --> 00:18:52.992
they can keep capturing well,

00:18:52.992 --> 00:18:54.472
they could finish now.

00:18:54.472 --> 00:18:54.862
Right now,

00:18:54.862 --> 00:18:58.012
when i finish when i finished,

00:18:58.012 --> 00:19:00.382
we're just going to provide you with a basic message,

00:19:00.752 --> 00:19:05.312
but soon what we're going to provide you with is a length directly to that

00:19:05.312 --> 00:19:09.352
capture so you can see and verified in your library or in their particular section

00:19:14.032 --> 00:19:14.342
no,

00:19:15.102 --> 00:19:16.422
uh could be oh,

00:19:16.642 --> 00:19:21.632
i'm gonna get to that hold that thought bill by the foot

00:19:21.722 --> 00:19:23.802
by the photo it is an hour ah,

00:19:23.802 --> 00:19:25.852
but certainly you could go much longer

00:19:29.142 --> 00:19:29.512
all right,

00:19:29.512 --> 00:19:31.152
so that's universal capture and again,

00:19:31.152 --> 00:19:35.802
this is the desktop education safari a ll the browsers are supported

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:40.742
universal look and feel the entire approach consistency across the board

00:19:41.652 --> 00:19:46.022
would want to jump back and show you uh

00:19:46.742 --> 00:19:51.392
how administrators can benefit from this so this should be familiar to most administrators

00:19:51.722 --> 00:19:56.522
this is the rooms page now with universal capture we've added this new icon it's a camera

00:19:56.522 --> 00:20:00.892
right now i think we're going to change it to a uh like a movie

00:20:01.602 --> 00:20:06.312
more of a movie type field but bye all of those rules were universal capture is

00:20:06.312 --> 00:20:10.922
enabled i could now click into that and see exactly what's going on so

00:20:11.732 --> 00:20:15.912
uh this is my this is my device here.

00:20:15.912 --> 00:20:20.642
This is i assume this is this is the room as an administrator i can go in

00:20:21.562 --> 00:20:25.552
and i can see exactly what's going on i could see the room,

00:20:25.772 --> 00:20:30.612
i can see the inputs all that sort of stuff i can see rob raising his

00:20:30.612 --> 00:20:34.282
handle this sort of good stuff right now currently we don't have audio,

00:20:34.572 --> 00:20:37.012
you can see the humidor and that's working perfectly fine,

00:20:37.282 --> 00:20:39.572
but we don't have actual audio that you can listen in to.

00:20:39.982 --> 00:20:43.682
That is certainly something that we're planning on adding in the future additionally,

00:20:43.682 --> 00:20:47.942
for administrators that come in and look at this want to provide you with analytics,

00:20:47.952 --> 00:20:48.232
right?

00:20:48.232 --> 00:20:53.082
So a history off the captains that have that have occurred in this room over the

00:20:53.082 --> 00:20:54.792
past week over the past month or what?

00:20:54.882 --> 00:20:59.702
What have you providing you with all sorts of information about downtime

00:20:59.712 --> 00:21:00.232
up time?

00:21:00.232 --> 00:21:02.432
How many hours of capture on this this device,

00:21:02.792 --> 00:21:06.092
perhaps even a schedule ofthe upcoming lectures,

00:21:06.092 --> 00:21:09.742
or captures that air gun occur in this room on this device?

00:21:10.162 --> 00:21:14.302
So one of empower you as an administrator's with as much information as possible,

00:21:14.652 --> 00:21:19.612
and hopefully this will feed into the reports that a teresa's building

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.792
out as well so that's,

00:21:21.792 --> 00:21:23.282
universal capture let's,

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:26.492
take a quick look at the road man.

00:21:30.352 --> 00:21:33.642
So we're super excited about some of the things that we want to build on here,

00:21:34.062 --> 00:21:39.002
but trying to be cognizant and mindful of the fact we have to maintain and

00:21:39.002 --> 00:21:43.782
keep it as simple as possible and easy to use for instructors in

00:21:43.782 --> 00:21:45.372
particular and all and use us.

00:21:45.702 --> 00:21:48.592
So a lot of these things that were proposing here and that we're working on,

00:21:49.142 --> 00:21:51.012
we're going on with that mindset,

00:21:51.022 --> 00:21:55.132
keeping a simple as possible so i won't go into all of these in detail.

00:21:55.132 --> 00:22:00.012
But for those of you who have signed up for the universal capture beta we

00:22:00.012 --> 00:22:02.472
have in our and our feedback forum,

00:22:02.782 --> 00:22:07.412
we have a similar version of this where we showing our major milestones,

00:22:07.692 --> 00:22:08.462
major mom,

00:22:08.592 --> 00:22:13.342
major and minor milestones we want toby is transparent as possible with you and let you

00:22:13.342 --> 00:22:17.872
know as much information as possible as we're rolling out some of these new

00:22:17.872 --> 00:22:22.752
features so right now we have make a wish and we're calling it shared mode but essentially this

00:22:22.752 --> 00:22:27.652
just classroom capture were working on personal capture and windows

00:22:27.652 --> 00:22:32.392
mode right now and al goal isto release both of these

00:22:32.552 --> 00:22:37.272
in the summer time frame to give you an opportunity to kind of kick the tires of test assault for yourselves

00:22:37.566 --> 00:22:41.226
before uh before university starts back up again

00:22:42.576 --> 00:22:47.556
just touching on some of these things here so getting back to bill's question here about can i can you kept

00:22:47.556 --> 00:22:52.426
it for more than one hour right now we have a limitation of four hours but we

00:22:52.426 --> 00:22:56.976
are going to extend this by august up to eight plus hours of capture

00:22:57.236 --> 00:23:02.006
so you could decision could go on an entire day kept everything that's going on the room and you

00:23:02.006 --> 00:23:06.946
golden somebody would probably have to come back and edited after the fact but if that's the workflow in the

00:23:06.946 --> 00:23:11.876
model that you want to support we want to be ableto provide their capability for you in order

00:23:11.876 --> 00:23:16.646
to update is what cassidy covered earlier we've got some major changes going on there especially

00:23:16.646 --> 00:23:21.286
excited about hls we want to be able to rip out flash from our system

00:23:22.016 --> 00:23:26.986
there's some other other benefits that come with that as well that's that development is actually going on

00:23:26.986 --> 00:23:31.956
right now so i anticipate we're going to see that earlier than we originally planned which

00:23:31.956 --> 00:23:36.906
is fantastic and it's going to probably follow the same model that we had with secure

00:23:36.906 --> 00:23:41.806
clown front and what i mean by that is we're going to enable this as an option for

00:23:41.806 --> 00:23:46.436
you and if we find out or if you let us know that there's any problems with hls

00:23:46.726 --> 00:23:50.326
we can immediately revert to the existing system okay?

00:23:50.326 --> 00:23:54.626
So we're trying to lessen the pain there if you will be provided as much flexibility as well

00:23:55.226 --> 00:24:00.126
confidence monitoring i test upon really briefly we've got big plans about adding more capabilities

00:24:00.126 --> 00:24:05.056
there especially around analytics and empowering administrators and then some other features

00:24:05.056 --> 00:24:09.966
there as well including narrow media playback and nair life playback feel free to

00:24:09.966 --> 00:24:12.826
take me if you have any questions or are curious about what those are

00:24:16.626 --> 00:24:21.306
uh they can see everything so any room that

00:24:21.306 --> 00:24:26.286
universal capture is installed them they can go in and see exactly what's going on in that room

00:24:27.506 --> 00:24:32.346
i should add i should add um so just to be

00:24:32.346 --> 00:24:36.936
clear there's two versions there's going to be classic capture and there's going to be

00:24:36.936 --> 00:24:41.784
personal capture classroom capture allows the administrators to go in a preview exactly what's

00:24:41.784 --> 00:24:46.464
going on over there that's that confidence monitoring piece personal capture

00:24:47.084 --> 00:24:51.634
in no way does that allow an administrator to see what's going on

00:24:51.984 --> 00:24:56.774
on a user's computer no way it'll okay so i want to make sure that's

00:24:56.774 --> 00:25:01.624
clear chris and claire to all users and instructed downloads in the stools

00:25:01.834 --> 00:25:05.124
personal capture nobody can see what's going on this screen

00:25:11.174 --> 00:25:15.964
yes or no conference wanted thing i get again that's something that we're building into kind of the

00:25:15.964 --> 00:25:20.724
confidence monetary peace be like hester grams ability the ability to actually

00:25:20.724 --> 00:25:25.554
listen into into a room so that you know whether the audio literal is high high

00:25:25.554 --> 00:25:29.544
enough forfeits too low you can possibly change their remotely

00:25:36.044 --> 00:25:40.994
yes with custom catcher does right now we're going to build a separate offline mode a cz

00:25:40.994 --> 00:25:45.794
part ofthe personal capture so if you're on a train perhaps or a few away

00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:50.644
from my wife like connection you still have to do a local capture and then it gets automatically

00:25:50.644 --> 00:25:55.524
uploaded the next time you go online uh this is a good

00:25:55.524 --> 00:26:00.234
one so just to respond to the comedy mate is that universal capture is a personal

00:26:00.244 --> 00:26:05.054
captures so just be clear about this this one code it's one solution but it

00:26:05.054 --> 00:26:09.864
does have to separate install modes one is kind of a shared install mode that you would

00:26:09.864 --> 00:26:14.814
use in a shared environment like this and one is a personal mode that you have on your own device for all the

00:26:14.814 --> 00:26:19.584
reasons tony to set imagine you were an instructor and you had this install on your

00:26:19.584 --> 00:26:24.434
laptop and somehow you're sitting at home recording in your living room and you're adam and kind

00:26:24.434 --> 00:26:26.954
of tunnel into your laptop and look at what's going on there.

00:26:26.954 --> 00:26:28.174
That would always be a problem.

00:26:28.184 --> 00:26:30.074
So but it's it's one.

00:26:30.174 --> 00:26:32.194
This one code based on two separate installments.

00:26:32.204 --> 00:26:32.864
Essentially,

00:26:33.454 --> 00:26:38.184
and as administrative you have control of whether or not you want to provide

00:26:38.194 --> 00:26:43.194
instructors with the ability to download personal capture very similar

00:26:43.194 --> 00:26:44.934
toe the options over provide today.

00:26:44.944 --> 00:26:47.354
So there'll be a tuggle tuggle.

00:26:47.724 --> 00:26:48.394
And then,

00:26:48.694 --> 00:26:52.084
when when and if you're ready to work with the instructors to say,

00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:52.524
hey,

00:26:52.524 --> 00:26:55.104
try out this new version of universal capture,

00:26:55.644 --> 00:27:00.064
enable their trouble that they can go to the downloads page and then download on stolen on their personal

00:27:00.064 --> 00:27:00.654
computers.

00:27:02.044 --> 00:27:02.484
Um,

00:27:02.724 --> 00:27:02.964
carey,

00:27:02.964 --> 00:27:03.194
please.

00:27:03.774 --> 00:27:04.294
Stolen

00:27:05.784 --> 00:27:10.464
way

00:27:10.474 --> 00:27:12.654
connected with correct

00:27:14.744 --> 00:27:16.014
way device.

00:27:18.544 --> 00:27:19.044
So it's,

00:27:19.524 --> 00:27:20.184
so basically,

00:27:20.184 --> 00:27:21.674
you're sitting for at this point,

00:27:21.724 --> 00:27:23.924
you wouldn't have to do that with personal catcher.

00:27:26.054 --> 00:27:26.334
Yeah,

00:27:27.044 --> 00:27:27.804
but in this case,

00:27:27.804 --> 00:27:28.664
and you're sitting up,

00:27:28.674 --> 00:27:30.494
think of it as you're setting up a podium,

00:27:30.494 --> 00:27:30.984
if you will.

00:27:31.304 --> 00:27:36.204
Singing oppa's a share device before we get i should

00:27:36.214 --> 00:27:40.414
mention for those of you who are not part of the data right now

00:27:40.424 --> 00:27:44.214
way have a button that specifically

00:27:45.084 --> 00:27:50.074
viewable by instructors it's an additional and secondary option for ad

00:27:50.084 --> 00:27:54.514
hoc captures through the browser the

00:27:54.674 --> 00:27:59.594
fuchsia button is beta written allover universal capture again we've tried

00:27:59.594 --> 00:28:04.544
to simplify the process of doing an ad hoc capture right now for those of you who are familiar

00:28:04.554 --> 00:28:09.274
with the process for instructors right now they have to select the room

00:28:09.524 --> 00:28:14.234
they have to select the device that just like the time you put the title

00:28:15.024 --> 00:28:19.914
i have to go through four or five different steps and doing and capture then it goes away and then struck this

00:28:19.914 --> 00:28:24.894
kind of blind whether or not a anything's actually going on with universal capture right now you

00:28:24.894 --> 00:28:29.794
select the room and away you go you see universal capture

00:28:29.804 --> 00:28:30.434
in the browser.

00:28:30.824 --> 00:28:31.064
Okay,

00:28:31.064 --> 00:28:35.844
so not only were we trying to provide more information for administrators but for instructors as well.

00:28:35.844 --> 00:28:38.064
So i just want to make sure i make that

00:28:42.288 --> 00:28:46.948
well some confusion about the having multiple versions.

00:28:47.218 --> 00:28:51.978
So maybe just clarify that again we've got one version one download to

00:28:51.978 --> 00:28:55.258
different basically install modes correct that's correct.

00:28:55.258 --> 00:28:59.398
So first vision is if you want a stolen for classroom capture

00:29:00.908 --> 00:29:05.498
that's what we currently have right now for mac os the second vision will be

00:29:05.498 --> 00:29:10.228
for personal capture so that's allowing your and uses or instructors to

00:29:10.238 --> 00:29:15.208
download on the machine you have no insight into the into what's actually going on in the machine you have no

00:29:15.208 --> 00:29:20.148
access rights or anything like that on dh that's very similar to the approach that we have

00:29:20.148 --> 00:29:24.478
right now when you look at our legacy options there are two downloads

00:29:25.188 --> 00:29:30.028
classroom capture personal capture on the pc personal capture only

00:29:30.038 --> 00:29:33.618
on the mac so following the same model

00:29:45.228 --> 00:29:50.078
tooling administrators always see two links classroom personal instructor's the

00:29:50.078 --> 00:29:54.848
end users will only see personal right instructors i'm gonna

00:29:54.848 --> 00:29:57.768
us i don't believe i'm going to set it up for you in a classroom environment

00:30:11.738 --> 00:30:16.668
for structures you don't have the power to see what you want to

00:30:16.668 --> 00:30:21.648
just mention how it's the react code base and how it's being developed so that we

00:30:21.648 --> 00:30:26.488
intend to have this on cross platform quickly did you mention that already tony and she covered it a little bit

00:30:26.498 --> 00:30:31.278
this warning soldier says a little bit of technical background so this is a war

00:30:31.548 --> 00:30:36.458
based on internet technologies and again that that provided that makes

00:30:36.458 --> 00:30:41.448
for a smarter solution allows us to grow in the future it's not going to become obsolete in the next six months

00:30:41.448 --> 00:30:46.448
the next twelve months but it's a shared code base roughly eighty to ninety percent off the code base

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:51.678
between mac and pc is entirely shared the

00:30:51.678 --> 00:30:56.208
only difference that ten percent difference comes in the actual capture engine itself and that's

00:30:56.208 --> 00:31:00.698
where a lot of the work actually goes in but the

00:31:00.708 --> 00:31:05.038
primary benefit for having a shared code base is whatever features we developed for mac

00:31:05.628 --> 00:31:10.128
automatically gets developed pc and vice versa and it just makes for a quicker development

00:31:12.068 --> 00:31:16.978
so people that's about the beta can use tell people how they want to use it to get access to it when i have to do procedure

00:31:17.558 --> 00:31:22.088
uh yes so there's a couple of options available

00:31:22.618 --> 00:31:27.368
one please feel free to contact linda or anybody on her team if you're interested in

00:31:27.368 --> 00:31:28.338
looking at the beta,

00:31:28.708 --> 00:31:33.278
we'll get you signed up we'll make it available for your tenant and then you'll start receiving

00:31:33.278 --> 00:31:37.938
notifications on the evan dashboard on a bimonthly basis we provide updates

00:31:37.948 --> 00:31:39.358
off any fixes,

00:31:39.358 --> 00:31:40.128
any enhancements,

00:31:40.128 --> 00:31:45.088
any changes that were made to universal catcher so you can work directly with wonder in a team you

00:31:45.088 --> 00:31:50.078
can feel free to contact me directly i'm happy to share my my cards

00:31:50.078 --> 00:31:50.308
are

00:32:00.868 --> 00:32:05.798
all right outstanding we're gonna cut it just because we're on a timetable here but that was great and there were a

00:32:05.798 --> 00:32:08.078
million questions so that was excellent,

00:32:08.088 --> 00:32:09.988
thanks very much tony

00:32:15.058 --> 00:32:19.978
so congratulations you made it barring a couple of announcements and

00:32:19.978 --> 00:32:22.518
quick things we want to say before we get into that,

amazon gift cards is this in any particular order or no no,

00:34:16.005 --> 00:34:20.225
i have no particular that's a top three terry wilmer from not him.

00:34:20.775 --> 00:34:21.225
All right.

00:34:25.975 --> 00:34:27.005
Congratulations.

00:34:27.495 --> 00:34:28.105
Uh,

00:34:28.115 --> 00:34:31.265
next laura mcnally from sheffield where you're here

00:34:33.545 --> 00:34:38.445
you're welcome and less but not least richard is a chandler chandler i can't read the

00:34:38.445 --> 00:34:40.735
writing from queen mary great.

00:34:45.055 --> 00:34:45.665
Okay,

00:34:46.445 --> 00:34:51.322
just anecdotally having been following the comments throughout the day on each session i

00:34:51.322 --> 00:34:54.772
feel like i wish we give everybody in war because there were tons and tons of comments,

00:34:54.772 --> 00:34:55.222
questions,

00:34:55.222 --> 00:34:57.242
interactions and that was great and hopefully,

00:34:57.522 --> 00:34:57.692
you know,

00:34:57.692 --> 00:35:02.522
i don't have any of you are involved with the technology but never really sit in a presentation using it

00:35:02.532 --> 00:35:07.302
maybe that was interesting experience toe kind of see what it was like is an end user if you're not

00:35:07.632 --> 00:35:08.492
you're not familiar with it,

00:35:08.632 --> 00:35:11.662
i won't say that never crossed our mind that would be a good experience,

00:35:12.992 --> 00:35:13.302
okay,

00:35:13.302 --> 00:35:18.182
i think that was all the housekeeping i think that was it in terms of things i'm supposed to do so

00:35:18.192 --> 00:35:22.812
in closing just to wrap it up you know i hope you feel like i do i think it was an

00:35:22.812 --> 00:35:27.602
outstanding day you know personal opinion since i have the michael give you my personal opinions i

00:35:27.602 --> 00:35:32.142
thought certainly all the presentations were excellent i like the timing it seemed like we had

00:35:32.392 --> 00:35:37.352
lots of kind of a quick half hour forty minute kinds of sessions on a variety of topics that

00:35:37.352 --> 00:35:42.162
was great there seem to be a nice balance of things that you want to know from echo and then

00:35:42.162 --> 00:35:46.892
things we heard about from customers which is great certainly the customer stories of fantastic i mean the

00:35:46.902 --> 00:35:51.832
stories that people told whether it was the speed or the scale of the the insight that they had

00:35:51.832 --> 00:35:56.832
or the process that they followed and hopefully that's information that's valuable to all of you and you can

00:35:56.832 --> 00:36:01.492
take that away and apply some of it to your own deployments which is really one of the main objectives for this whole thing

00:36:02.482 --> 00:36:07.372
remember everybody had homework i don't have more gift cards but how many people uh how many people

00:36:07.372 --> 00:36:12.322
met at least three people they hadn't met before every hand better go off then

00:36:12.332 --> 00:36:16.482
okay let's keep going how many will skip how many five people that hadn't met before

00:36:18.382 --> 00:36:22.912
i get better jump fashion about ten how many people met ten way go now

00:36:22.922 --> 00:36:27.792
yeah so the magic number is somewhere between five and ten that's great well and hope you

00:36:27.792 --> 00:36:32.732
exchange contact details and on you know you can kind of coordinate things moving forward and

00:36:32.732 --> 00:36:33.912
keep the communication going.

00:36:34.242 --> 00:36:38.172
We always get great feedback about how great it is to hear stories and talk to other people,

00:36:38.392 --> 00:36:42.762
but it shouldn't only happen once a year so that that's on you guys to try to keep the communication

00:36:43.182 --> 00:36:48.152
going and flowing so everybody that was involved in organizing this event

00:36:48.162 --> 00:36:52.878
thank you very much again our friends at king's college for being incredible hosts again the

00:36:52.888 --> 00:36:54.978
bar's high end but where's lauren bar's pretty high,

00:36:54.978 --> 00:36:57.518
so yeah way we believe you,

00:36:57.518 --> 00:37:02.148
but thanks to everybody from from kings who has been involved in organizing this toe,

00:37:02.148 --> 00:37:04.478
linda and her team who put a lot of energy into it,

00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:08.938
so great job by all of you and it's tim here we're temps always sneaks out

00:37:09.198 --> 00:37:09.528
tim,

00:37:09.528 --> 00:37:10.308
we're the tall,

00:37:10.558 --> 00:37:15.288
skinny guy he's the guy that does all the organizing of the logistics and everything from the

00:37:15.288 --> 00:37:20.018
name tags to the food to the whatever a ton of work that he puts into this and he usually
