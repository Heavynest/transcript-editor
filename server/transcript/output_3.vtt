00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780
John said earlier i'm elsa maloney i am with the asia pacific time on dh my 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.690
role is to work with our universities and tastes and 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.620
colleges around the adoption off the features beyond electric 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.550
actor so lecter captures going on that's all wonderful and great but what else 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.890
can we use the system for?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.520
And in fact how could you you don't even have tohave lecture capture you khun still use so many of 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.440
these features and tools so one of the things that i'm kind of curious about having seen the list of who 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.100
registered versus the list of who tear today because it could be an interesting session 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.840
how many people here actually teach lecture are professors in france 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.520
students also friendless you know this?

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.560
Um how many people here work with academics and 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.640
actually trained them on how to use the system and how to teach with it brilliant?

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.980
All right,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.750
so we've got we've got all the right crowd here was just a bit worried you model that she talking to us about 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.760
teaching because that's what this session is about this session is about teaching 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.260
and one of the things that i've heard said a lot of i'm sure you've heard it it's been said more and more of the last few 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.520
years is that education has changed more in the last ten years than in the last thousand 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.090
people said conferences there talking about it in meetings but 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.200
one of the things that i think you know it's really clear sometimes we get a little bit anxious that 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.870
all this there's just so much change,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.300
you know what the actual teaching hasn't changed when the way in 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.250
which people learn and the teaching that we need to do is same as it always was active 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.240
learning has been around for a very,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.110
very long time,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.110
it's just that we've kind of brought it back up again active learning,

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.200
formative assessment,

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.450
all of those kinds of buzzwords and things that we're hearing have been around for a long time,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.240
and we've known that it's the best way that students learn what i think is the big difference 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.925
is that before you would be talking about having to do formative assessment 

00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:05.025
with three hundred students and be like,

00:02:05.115 --> 00:02:07.575
how on earth am i going to mark all of that,

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.275
find out what they're all doing,

00:02:09.435 --> 00:02:12.875
seal of the results and what technology is done now,

00:02:12.885 --> 00:02:17.795
i think it enabled us to teach in the way that we always knew we should or many of us 

00:02:17.795 --> 00:02:18.605
were doing,

00:02:18.685 --> 00:02:22.845
but maybe pull back a little bit because the lord was actually fairly overwhelming.

00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:24.375
All right?

00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:25.565
So now,

00:02:25.575 --> 00:02:28.885
because i'm from australia and i had to think about some content to talk about,

00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:30.135
i thought i'd do something is ryan,

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:35.105
i did have the click of a button um and you know we like to talk about 

00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:40.105
yourself so here i am here's australia this is where i'm from i'm at you from the west coast 

00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:45.825
so i'm from here in paris which is where electric capture actually was 

00:02:45.825 --> 00:02:50.785
created before it became too hard off echo three sixty s o we're very proud of that 

00:02:50.785 --> 00:02:55.555
fact so i've been lucky enough in my career as an 

00:02:55.555 --> 00:03:00.145
educated to have travelled the world many times too many different places and worked with lots of different 

00:03:00.145 --> 00:03:05.135
educators it's it's pretty pretty cool career one of the things that i found 

00:03:05.135 --> 00:03:09.765
and this has changed now again with technology people know so much more about australia now than they used to 

00:03:10.155 --> 00:03:15.005
but twenty years ago when i first started working with teachers from around the world i would 

00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:19.495
find that sometimes there wasn't a great amount of knowledge about australia and so you know,

00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:24.005
i would get quote back then of course there was the crocodile hunter steve irwin 

00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:27.165
rest in peace um but you know,

00:03:27.175 --> 00:03:27.925
people would say,

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:29.745
what do you know stay there with like,

00:03:29.755 --> 00:03:30.175
you know,

00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:34.385
because i live in perth and hey lives here and you know,

00:03:34.385 --> 00:03:39.315
it's a six hour flight to get there kind of thing and you know that happens and then i 

00:03:39.315 --> 00:03:43.775
had a couple of other beautiful ones that i thought i would share with you types of questions that i used to get asked 

00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:47.955
so particularly you know,

00:03:47.985 --> 00:03:52.045
i'm in the south go to the north our summers a different 

00:03:53.145 --> 00:03:58.055
so we have summer at the end of the day calendar year you have it in the middle the us 

00:03:58.055 --> 00:04:02.482
two and more than once somebody said to me oh,

00:04:02.562 --> 00:04:05.532
so if you're summers in december when you celebrate christmas 

00:04:07.992 --> 00:04:08.532
okay,

00:04:08.632 --> 00:04:13.402
i'm trying and then my other side but i gotta ask twice because i 

00:04:13.412 --> 00:04:17.772
was always worked in teacher professional development and back in the olden days before we had all this beautiful 

00:04:17.772 --> 00:04:22.332
technology we used to give like binders and books and a ll this printed 

00:04:22.332 --> 00:04:27.042
material they would look through and i remember being in north america one time and,

00:04:27.042 --> 00:04:27.202
you know,

00:04:27.202 --> 00:04:29.002
get their spelling slightly different you know,

00:04:29.012 --> 00:04:33.782
we used british spelling spelling is quite slightly different we've gotta you 

00:04:33.782 --> 00:04:38.752
where where it shouldn't be apparently and one time i was asked so how many 

00:04:38.752 --> 00:04:43.562
letters in your alphabet on that first time i single twenty six okay,

00:04:43.572 --> 00:04:48.542
this is dawn it happened again and this time i said twelve and the light 

00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:53.172
and i walked away after twelve when what when the lady wave you could see him behind 

00:04:53.172 --> 00:04:54.572
processing intimate oh,

00:04:54.582 --> 00:04:55.092
come on,

00:04:55.452 --> 00:04:56.652
i get it sorry,

00:04:56.862 --> 00:04:57.322
that wasn't,

00:04:57.592 --> 00:04:57.992
you know,

00:04:57.992 --> 00:04:58.522
really smart,

00:04:59.142 --> 00:05:00.752
but i'm not picking on other people,

00:05:00.762 --> 00:05:01.082
you know,

00:05:01.082 --> 00:05:05.392
this kind of thing happened to make when i was working in north america,

00:05:05.402 --> 00:05:10.032
i learned that there are actually fifty states and i thought they were fifty two 

00:05:11.042 --> 00:05:15.172
and i was not alone in that i actually went home and did research when i got back you know,

00:05:15.172 --> 00:05:20.132
after i discovered their fifty states in america and i said to you how state in 

00:05:20.132 --> 00:05:23.452
the u s and they go fifty two and it was like,

00:05:23.462 --> 00:05:24.642
how is that happened?

00:05:24.652 --> 00:05:29.432
So i figured it out we don't study north america at school in 

00:05:29.432 --> 00:05:29.952
australia,

00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:35.502
but we obviously we used to hear the news and we'd hear about it and we would hear about the 

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:39.492
sixty united states and then we would also hear 

00:05:40.482 --> 00:05:45.332
the contiguous united states plus a lester in hawaii and somehow in air mai's 

00:05:45.932 --> 00:05:50.132
we had created that there were fifty two states i use those 

00:05:50.132 --> 00:05:54.662
examples because what i want to talk about today with teaching is the 

00:05:54.662 --> 00:05:56.022
importance of knowledge,

00:05:56.752 --> 00:05:57.132
right?

00:05:57.462 --> 00:06:02.102
We talk a lot about the importance of these 

00:06:02.227 --> 00:06:03.997
higher order thinking skills,

00:06:03.997 --> 00:06:04.287
right?

00:06:04.287 --> 00:06:09.057
We've got that's not used to this right?

00:06:10.587 --> 00:06:11.677
We've got balloons,

00:06:11.677 --> 00:06:12.287
taxonomy,

00:06:12.287 --> 00:06:12.497
right?

00:06:12.507 --> 00:06:15.937
Everybody has it i think every university at some point it talks about balloons,

00:06:15.937 --> 00:06:17.387
taxonomy and has blooms talks,

00:06:17.437 --> 00:06:18.617
taxonomy of learning right?

00:06:19.057 --> 00:06:23.957
It's some of the great stuff that we've been doing forever was first created in the fifties and then 

00:06:23.957 --> 00:06:28.807
re down in the eighties and so we know it's really important and one of the things that i hear a lot 

00:06:28.817 --> 00:06:33.797
is we need to focus on the higher order thinking don't spend time on the 

00:06:33.797 --> 00:06:38.667
lower order thinking the students know that they should get that primary school in high school and 

00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:43.337
it's all about critical thinking and then i read an article recently might have even been here 

00:06:43.507 --> 00:06:48.267
which was talking about the fact that students don't have critical thinking skills and the 

00:06:48.277 --> 00:06:53.077
reason that i tell you my stories about people whose got the facts wrong is 

00:06:53.077 --> 00:06:56.867
not to say although complete silly because these were all people with university degrees 

00:06:57.857 --> 00:07:02.807
it's that really important thing off if you don't have the right knowledge and content 

00:07:04.107 --> 00:07:09.067
then you can't have do the higher one of thinking those kinds of 

00:07:09.067 --> 00:07:13.907
activities don't work very well imagine if someone had given me some kind of economics 

00:07:13.917 --> 00:07:18.737
higher order activity to do around finances and i was trying to figure it 

00:07:18.737 --> 00:07:23.457
out for the united states and i'm trying to figure it out around fifty two states and they're actually fifty 

00:07:24.967 --> 00:07:29.877
so one of the things that echo three sixty khun do really well for us and don't 

00:07:29.887 --> 00:07:34.537
i do not want you to hear me say it's not about higher order thinking skills you absolutely can 

00:07:35.307 --> 00:07:40.167
but what i thought i would focus on in the station today is how we can use echo 

00:07:40.167 --> 00:07:44.657
three sixty to really support students around the knowledge that they need to have 

00:07:45.457 --> 00:07:50.167
because the fact is students need to have a very 

00:07:50.167 --> 00:07:54.677
solid basis off content and understanding in your 

00:07:54.677 --> 00:07:55.227
discipline,

00:07:55.867 --> 00:07:58.347
they need to have the language in your discipline,

00:07:58.357 --> 00:08:03.329
you need to model for them and show them what language they have to use if they're going to be a 

00:08:03.329 --> 00:08:03.739
lawyer,

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:04.369
a doctor,

00:08:04.519 --> 00:08:05.109
a teacher,

00:08:05.229 --> 00:08:09.609
whatever it is that they're trying to bay your job is to show them what that is,

00:08:09.659 --> 00:08:10.779
what is the language?

00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:15.929
What is the content that they need to have that kind of what i'm going to do 

00:08:15.939 --> 00:08:20.789
today is i want to use the platform with you to just show you a 

00:08:20.789 --> 00:08:25.569
couple of different ways that you can use this to enhance 

00:08:25.569 --> 00:08:25.969
knowledge.

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:26.399
Now,

00:08:26.409 --> 00:08:28.569
i know one of the big arguments we get is,

00:08:28.569 --> 00:08:28.739
well,

00:08:28.739 --> 00:08:29.599
it's about time,

00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:31.999
and we also might hear,

00:08:31.999 --> 00:08:34.659
and i know i used to feel this way quite strongly was about,

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:35.039
well,

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:38.119
i don't really want to spend the time on this knowledge is,

00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:39.499
you know,

00:08:39.569 --> 00:08:41.959
i don't want to in fanta lies the students,

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:43.719
i don't want them to feel that,

00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:43.909
you know,

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.239
we should be doing this critical thinking in this bigger order,

00:08:46.239 --> 00:08:46.639
thinking,

00:08:46.639 --> 00:08:46.849
well,

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:50.409
actually there's a place because if they've got the facts wrong,

00:08:50.749 --> 00:08:52.829
then the rest of it is goingto crumble,

00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:56.299
so we've got to make sure that effect so i thought 

00:08:57.959 --> 00:09:01.979
we would look at and i have to introduce and stuff on here cause i've hidden some of my slides 

00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:09.039
i'm gonna ask you plays to 

00:09:09.629 --> 00:09:14.529
open up your notes i don't press the 

00:09:14.529 --> 00:09:17.549
wrong thing here but can i have my screen 

00:09:21.989 --> 00:09:26.869
logged in isn't instruct another you know where the knights terry's so can i 

00:09:26.869 --> 00:09:31.789
get you to open your night saying can you if your neighbor doesn't know what the knight sabers because i know there's some people that don't know echo 

00:09:31.789 --> 00:09:36.729
in here i say can't or do you think so what i want you to do now is i 

00:09:36.729 --> 00:09:41.169
just want you to write in that night's tab everything you think of when i say cane toad 

00:09:41.939 --> 00:09:44.159
now you might go out have never heard of a cane toad well,

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:48.579
you might not have been a bit his head of cain and i bet you're sort of toad and a bit you could figure something out 

00:09:49.849 --> 00:09:53.999
so just have a going just right in that night space 

00:10:20.978 --> 00:10:28.748
wait 

00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:31.748
okay,

00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:36.768
i'm gonna stop you there what i'd like you to do now places can you just talk to your neighbor 

00:10:37.208 --> 00:10:41.378
about what you think when i came right?

00:10:41.388 --> 00:10:46.338
I'm just gonna give you a minute just have a quick chat with you never see if you can learn anything else that you can add two nights 

00:11:08.628 --> 00:11:12.768
e 

00:11:25.788 --> 00:11:26.248
all right,

00:11:26.768 --> 00:11:29.538
thank you for that write down any new nights,

00:11:29.538 --> 00:11:34.168
any new facts that you learned about cain times you can pop them there into notes next to that's 

00:11:34.168 --> 00:11:40.918
lithe 

00:11:41.528 --> 00:11:42.228
so what?

00:11:42.238 --> 00:11:46.348
What we've just done is i'm not your teacher back kind words today,

00:11:47.898 --> 00:11:48.948
but what i've done is,

00:11:48.948 --> 00:11:50.418
before i get into the lesson,

00:11:50.428 --> 00:11:51.798
i've actually done some connecting,

00:11:51.848 --> 00:11:52.218
right?

00:11:52.668 --> 00:11:57.328
So what have i asked you to do is ask you to actually get in there to your prior knowledge and think about 

00:11:57.338 --> 00:11:57.808
everything,

00:11:57.808 --> 00:11:58.158
you know,

00:11:58.158 --> 00:12:03.078
so what i'm doing is i'm prime ing you for learning a and b i'm 

00:12:03.078 --> 00:12:08.063
also starting teo to reveal for you any types effects that 

00:12:08.063 --> 00:12:08.763
you might have wrong.

00:12:09.213 --> 00:12:11.383
So you've got everything down there that you think,

00:12:11.383 --> 00:12:11.883
you know,

00:12:11.893 --> 00:12:13.613
and now i'm going to tell you the facts,

00:12:14.223 --> 00:12:17.263
and you'll be out of delete and get rid of the things that may be out,

00:12:17.263 --> 00:12:17.503
right?

00:12:17.513 --> 00:12:17.923
Because it's,

00:12:17.923 --> 00:12:21.943
critical that i actually resolve that for you and that i do that quite quickly,

00:12:23.023 --> 00:12:25.753
and the other thing is that's really important were going toe dhoom,

00:12:25.753 --> 00:12:30.553
or about this as we go through is how many times i can get you to kind of practice the 

00:12:30.553 --> 00:12:33.823
new knowledge and the new content because as you know,

00:12:34.143 --> 00:12:35.253
your brains,

00:12:35.603 --> 00:12:39.303
they liked to go the easy route and that once they've got a piece of knowledge,

00:12:39.303 --> 00:12:44.303
if they think it's right that's going to stay right forever until we actually correct it and correcting 

00:12:44.303 --> 00:12:49.213
it isn't always as much is just telling you the right answer you actually sometimes have to practice 

00:12:49.213 --> 00:12:51.673
it think about it right?

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:56.503
Right right to think about this is if you ever moved house or move jobs and you've 

00:12:56.513 --> 00:13:01.223
driving driving home and suddenly have gone to your old house right if 

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:02.373
that happened right,

00:13:02.373 --> 00:13:07.303
you start because what happened is your brain has has practised in practise and practise and practise 

00:13:07.413 --> 00:13:12.033
and going oh yeah that's the way you go and then you get described distracted and the next thing is you're like,

00:13:12.043 --> 00:13:15.343
oh i met you at the wrong house is where i live how did that happen?

00:13:15.593 --> 00:13:20.553
So we have to give students opportunities to put those new pathways in for learning 

00:13:20.693 --> 00:13:25.643
right and that's also some of what we're going to do through this so connecting is one way right connecting 

00:13:25.643 --> 00:13:30.543
to the old information so that you could bring it forward and have new information to it and think to 

00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:35.343
it connecting if you're let's see what's on that extreme weather right got perry here that's his field 

00:13:36.323 --> 00:13:41.293
if somebody said something about extreme weather such as you know it only snows 

00:13:41.523 --> 00:13:46.093
when it's below minus twenty centigrade that's that's true 

00:13:46.693 --> 00:13:49.243
if somebody says that to me i'm gonna go oh isn't that interesting?

00:13:49.243 --> 00:13:54.123
John did you know that only snows on the map i don't know perry is going to he's got 

00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:58.953
all that information that he connects that too and he's able to say that's rubbish moving 

00:13:58.953 --> 00:14:00.923
on or oh isn't that interesting?

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:05.808
I'm gonna add it to all of my other information so i formulating make those connections 

00:14:05.998 --> 00:14:10.938
i'm getting you ready for the next piece of information now just be very grateful there is no examine came 

00:14:10.938 --> 00:14:13.388
towards the end of this is just an example.

00:14:14.268 --> 00:14:14.638
All right,

00:14:15.738 --> 00:14:16.148
so 

00:14:22.188 --> 00:14:27.038
here is that kind of time isn't it delightful what i'd 

00:14:27.038 --> 00:14:31.658
like you to do it now before we move on and i start talking too about the facts just open up the 

00:14:31.658 --> 00:14:32.368
question 

00:14:38.198 --> 00:14:39.648
can you make notes through the app?

00:14:39.738 --> 00:14:44.658
Good question that's not the way we're gonna answer now we'll talk about that i promised but before that i've written 

00:14:44.658 --> 00:14:49.408
two statements here it is i'm going to tell you that came towards his two statements 

00:14:49.738 --> 00:14:53.148
introducing cane toads to australia has positively impacted the country 

00:14:55.088 --> 00:14:57.978
then stray wishes that i hadn't introduced cane toads into the country.

00:14:58.328 --> 00:14:58.698
All right?

00:14:58.718 --> 00:15:03.308
What i want you to do now is to predict wantyou to predict what's coming next 

00:15:03.578 --> 00:15:08.538
what what kinds of things i'm going to say and so i want you to decide which 

00:15:08.538 --> 00:15:09.988
one of those you think is accurate,

00:15:10.298 --> 00:15:10.928
but guess what?

00:15:10.938 --> 00:15:15.928
I don't want you to write anything i want you two thumbs up the one that you think is right 

00:15:26.688 --> 00:15:27.358
what's cross 

00:15:31.978 --> 00:15:35.238
fires can't you mike nights through the app at the moment?

00:15:35.238 --> 00:15:35.788
No,

00:15:36.038 --> 00:15:36.908
but it is coming.

00:15:36.908 --> 00:15:37.288
In fact,

00:15:37.288 --> 00:15:42.168
i think through it was really is going to be released this week through the 

00:15:42.918 --> 00:15:44.448
not the ios at the other one.

00:15:46.568 --> 00:15:46.928
Yes,

00:15:46.928 --> 00:15:47.398
thank you.

00:15:47.638 --> 00:15:48.128
It was a big,

00:15:48.128 --> 00:15:51.768
long really difficult to remember with through the android,

00:15:51.768 --> 00:15:54.798
the knights will be and i always is coming so they are working on it.

00:15:54.808 --> 00:15:55.788
But right now today,

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:56.408
unfortunately,

00:15:56.408 --> 00:15:59.458
no that's definitely will be there isn't okay,

00:16:00.348 --> 00:16:00.838
awesome!

00:16:01.588 --> 00:16:06.213
So i've got five people here who's got the wrong idea so it's really important and with 

00:16:06.213 --> 00:16:07.993
predicting that i tell you the right idea,

00:16:08.003 --> 00:16:08.273
right?

00:16:08.513 --> 00:16:09.263
So actually,

00:16:09.263 --> 00:16:11.733
australia wishes that they had not introduced kane tides,

00:16:11.733 --> 00:16:13.493
and i'm going to tell you why in just a second.

00:16:14.143 --> 00:16:18.953
But here is a great way without me having to spend a lot of time to 

00:16:18.963 --> 00:16:23.253
actually find out where the heads are off my students around this stuff.

00:16:24.123 --> 00:16:29.043
If i had discovered that actually you were fifty fifty what a great opportunity to say turn to patton and 

00:16:29.043 --> 00:16:32.383
tell him why you're right that appear to be a teaching,

00:16:32.643 --> 00:16:35.173
because as you as i'm sure you will know,

00:16:35.503 --> 00:16:36.703
you might think something,

00:16:36.703 --> 00:16:38.173
and as soon as you try to explain it,

00:16:38.173 --> 00:16:39.233
somebody else that's,

00:16:39.233 --> 00:16:39.633
when you go,

00:16:39.643 --> 00:16:39.853
oh,

00:16:39.853 --> 00:16:40.523
i know i'm wrong,

00:16:41.643 --> 00:16:46.403
it's a really great strategy to use to actually talk to each other about why you think you're 

00:16:46.403 --> 00:16:51.223
right so that with this probably just correct 

00:16:51.223 --> 00:16:53.983
it and actually it's not it was not a great thing,

00:16:54.223 --> 00:16:55.563
and now i'm going to move on,

00:16:57.073 --> 00:17:01.793
but a little bit about predicting to one of the things that research has 

00:17:01.793 --> 00:17:06.423
shown us about predicting is that actually we often do 

00:17:06.423 --> 00:17:10.973
better in our learning and ate our exams if we 

00:17:10.973 --> 00:17:12.573
predicted something and we got it wrong?

00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:13.923
Because,

00:17:13.923 --> 00:17:14.623
again,

00:17:14.673 --> 00:17:19.523
what it's doing is predicting those two things one it's preparing you for the 

00:17:19.523 --> 00:17:21.253
types of questions that i might ask you,

00:17:21.563 --> 00:17:24.173
so you're starting to think in that way right now,

00:17:24.173 --> 00:17:25.973
you already think starting to think okay,

00:17:25.983 --> 00:17:30.683
going to be about why australia wishes that had introduced cane toads number one and number 

00:17:30.683 --> 00:17:33.923
two it also opens up that door for you to go,

00:17:33.933 --> 00:17:34.353
okay,

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:36.673
i was wrong now when they find out what the right answer is,

00:17:36.853 --> 00:17:41.413
so yet again it's one more focus on how am i going to get that neural pathway 

00:17:41.723 --> 00:17:42.583
to the right outside?

00:17:43.413 --> 00:17:44.453
So but again,

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:48.603
the key thing here is it doesn't take long now i'm doing a lot of,

00:17:49.393 --> 00:17:49.913
um,

00:17:50.093 --> 00:17:51.753
activities around the same thing,

00:17:51.753 --> 00:17:56.103
but if i was actually victory and this was a serious kind of class 

00:17:57.083 --> 00:18:01.913
i would probably just do the the one i would get you to do the connecting at the beginning of 

00:18:01.913 --> 00:18:06.674
the semester and then another day i would do some 

00:18:06.674 --> 00:18:07.914
predicting right?

00:18:08.014 --> 00:18:12.704
I might do a different activity every class but it wouldn't necessarily around my whole class this way so 

00:18:13.144 --> 00:18:17.944
so you get that but i thought i'd just make that point the idea is that these kinds of things that 

00:18:17.944 --> 00:18:22.934
really support and strength and students learning can be done in five minutes it's just 

00:18:22.934 --> 00:18:26.364
five minutes out of the class but it will actually help the students do better at the end 

00:18:28.074 --> 00:18:28.524
okay,

00:18:29.644 --> 00:18:34.604
so i 

00:18:34.604 --> 00:18:39.574
love this little thing you haven't seen it before my lover i don't know how many 

00:18:39.574 --> 00:18:42.454
times i've wanted to go back to a slide in the past and gone dick dick,

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:42.644
dick,

00:18:42.644 --> 00:18:42.834
dick,

00:18:42.834 --> 00:18:47.554
dick dick dick right but now i just go to that little doobie and i said right want to go back 

00:18:47.554 --> 00:18:52.104
here it is officially called dubey what do the 

00:18:52.574 --> 00:18:55.404
sometimes open up unites again?

00:18:55.404 --> 00:18:59.434
Not on this slide on the slide your own on the toads like i just want to show you this one 

00:19:00.194 --> 00:19:05.064
so we're going to start off by talking about queensland because now what i'm gonna do is i'm actually going to 

00:19:05.064 --> 00:19:08.484
give you some accurate facts and i wanted to show you queensland up here 

00:19:09.574 --> 00:19:14.534
hotter and more humid and very tropical at the top moving down to more temperate and then it obviously 

00:19:14.544 --> 00:19:19.424
as you get to the bottom of australia it gets cool cooler we get snow around sydney camera 

00:19:19.634 --> 00:19:22.384
and in testimony so it gets colder 

00:19:24.724 --> 00:19:29.574
all right back to this guy we'll tell you story about cane toads and you get to write notes as i'm 

00:19:29.574 --> 00:19:34.444
talking so that you know the facts you'll notice that your right the nights if you're new to this platform 

00:19:34.624 --> 00:19:39.554
bed in actual fact now you've got a different number next to it is the idea obviously is that you conflict between the 

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:44.174
slides to see you different nights so um 

00:19:45.234 --> 00:19:50.064
in about eighteen sixty australia decided that it would have the perfect climate 

00:19:50.154 --> 00:19:54.934
to grow okay all right sugar cane which is a huge industry and in fact the strain's 

00:19:54.934 --> 00:19:59.664
still does very well off it right now so we did that and then in 

00:19:59.664 --> 00:20:04.574
about eighteen eighty we suddenly realized we had a problem there were thirteen different kinds 

00:20:04.574 --> 00:20:09.232
of beetle there were eating the cake they were eating the stands that we're eating the roots that was 

00:20:09.232 --> 00:20:14.022
killing the cane and so at the time those that grew came said 

00:20:14.432 --> 00:20:19.152
we need to do something about this and they convinced the australian government something had to be done so the 

00:20:19.152 --> 00:20:23.642
government tested lots of different solutions and nothing worked nothing like 

00:20:24.742 --> 00:20:29.712
round about nineteen thirty five one of the guys in an agricultural department 

00:20:29.712 --> 00:20:34.512
learned about this cane toad that have been incredibly successful it originated 

00:20:35.022 --> 00:20:39.522
south from south america south and central america it had 

00:20:39.522 --> 00:20:44.362
been introduced into puerto rico to solve their came 

00:20:44.372 --> 00:20:49.352
little problem it had then been introduced into hawaii and solve their came little problem 

00:20:49.692 --> 00:20:54.622
so it's straight it's a great that's what we need without doing the testing but they're 

00:20:54.622 --> 00:20:59.222
usually too they said let's bring him in so what they did was they brought in one 

00:20:59.222 --> 00:21:03.972
hundred one kind it was actually supposed to be one hundred two but one of the 

00:21:04.192 --> 00:21:09.012
male kind tides died on the way so there were fifty one female in fifty miles hearts so they 

00:21:09.012 --> 00:21:13.422
come in they put them in a little century and they 

00:21:13.692 --> 00:21:14.532
uh they read.

00:21:15.292 --> 00:21:19.982
So what happened was within a week the female tides had started to like the wrecks 

00:21:20.862 --> 00:21:21.562
and guess what?

00:21:21.612 --> 00:21:26.592
A female typing lay up to thirty thousand eggs at a time now they don't 

00:21:26.602 --> 00:21:30.792
all hatch and become temples and frogs that five percent but that's still a lot.

00:21:31.152 --> 00:21:35.072
So within several weeks we had thousands of cane toads 

00:21:36.262 --> 00:21:36.862
that's what we wanted,

00:21:37.332 --> 00:21:40.742
so we took the map and we put them in the cane fields with ago eight,

00:21:40.752 --> 00:21:40.992
eight,

00:21:40.992 --> 00:21:45.142
eight eight of course the came tides from 

00:21:45.912 --> 00:21:50.352
north america don't like the native australian vigils 

00:21:50.922 --> 00:21:55.102
so they didn't need one theory that's that's true,

00:21:55.112 --> 00:21:59.882
i had did read some somewhere else that part of the problem too was that because came towards 

00:21:59.882 --> 00:22:04.212
can't leap couldn't you get higher up in the cane to eat the bagels?

00:22:04.512 --> 00:22:05.682
So that didn't work?

00:22:05.692 --> 00:22:07.607
Either i have to do that is,

00:22:07.837 --> 00:22:08.117
you know,

00:22:08.967 --> 00:22:09.567
i don't know,

00:22:09.577 --> 00:22:11.227
but it sounds like a good fact to me,

00:22:11.237 --> 00:22:12.987
so i'm going with it so they couldn't,

00:22:12.997 --> 00:22:15.997
so that didn't happen now kind words as you can see,

00:22:15.997 --> 00:22:17.597
they haven't like a dry,

00:22:17.597 --> 00:22:18.537
warty skin,

00:22:19.197 --> 00:22:20.977
i think they're pretty disgusting myself anyway,

00:22:22.357 --> 00:22:27.077
they and they tend to walk kind of more on their back legs and they have very quite a 

00:22:27.077 --> 00:22:31.837
short stride that you can see above their 

00:22:31.847 --> 00:22:36.507
eyes just next eyes here this is a gland and that gland 

00:22:36.507 --> 00:22:41.167
actually contains a toxin so that and it can 

00:22:41.167 --> 00:22:41.847
poison things.

00:22:41.847 --> 00:22:46.607
So there were a couple of things that happened one wass not only did the cane toads not like air 

00:22:46.607 --> 00:22:47.187
beetles,

00:22:48.637 --> 00:22:53.597
they liked her other insects so that i have honey bees and they need their other insects that 

00:22:53.597 --> 00:22:54.107
we love.

00:22:54.757 --> 00:22:55.877
That was one issue,

00:22:55.987 --> 00:23:00.637
but the second one was our australian animals started to eat the countered that the great the 

00:23:00.637 --> 00:23:03.937
dingoes think joanna's snakes beautiful his dinner,

00:23:04.617 --> 00:23:06.297
and so they would ate the cane toads,

00:23:06.297 --> 00:23:06.717
and of course,

00:23:06.717 --> 00:23:11.447
the cane toads have this toxin and it would get around them out and it would 

00:23:11.457 --> 00:23:16.207
kill them because one of things that came to toads do which that's quite clever is there 

00:23:16.207 --> 00:23:20.917
talks and speeds that we had right so the poison moves around faster and 

00:23:20.917 --> 00:23:24.857
actually ends up killing so a couple of other facts we don't no,

00:23:24.857 --> 00:23:29.427
we don't need to know everything about cane toads martorana there now 

00:23:29.427 --> 00:23:33.917
say we have about one and a half billion cane toads in australia 

00:23:34.627 --> 00:23:39.107
they started in queensland and they started to migrate because they breed so 

00:23:39.107 --> 00:23:44.037
prolific play and they're really not many natural predators they just 

00:23:44.147 --> 00:23:48.907
are ruling the country so they're taking over there eating pet food if they can get into somebody's 

00:23:48.907 --> 00:23:53.717
house on dh they are actually making some of their captain dogs quite sick if they decide to eat 

00:23:53.717 --> 00:23:53.927
them.

00:23:54.177 --> 00:23:58.857
I did hear a story once about people because it the toxin makes your heart right 

00:23:59.427 --> 00:24:04.277
going to be like lsd and actually licking the tides but i can tell you now don't do 

00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:09.217
it do not do it it will only make you see second potentially kill you so don't 

00:24:09.227 --> 00:24:14.107
do that so one of the things that's fascinating is that spread right they've 

00:24:14.107 --> 00:24:18.567
spread into northern territory by two thousand nine they were in western australia 

00:24:19.067 --> 00:24:24.007
when they first started breeding and spreading they would move about ten kilometers a year 

00:24:24.017 --> 00:24:28.047
now they move more like sixty kilometers a year what actually is him?

00:24:28.047 --> 00:24:29.067
When they first came,

00:24:29.067 --> 00:24:31.497
they liked it damp and hot,

00:24:31.877 --> 00:24:36.827
and they would breed on the only in the move on me in the wet weather what's happened is they've 

00:24:36.827 --> 00:24:38.687
moved across australia into the drier,

00:24:38.687 --> 00:24:40.997
hotter states is they've actually adapted,

00:24:41.897 --> 00:24:44.637
they've adapted to get longer legs so that they move faster,

00:24:44.807 --> 00:24:47.227
they've adapted to be out of tolerate dry heat,

00:24:47.947 --> 00:24:50.937
they've adapted in all sorts of horrible ways i'm gonna stop talking about them now,

00:24:50.947 --> 00:24:52.977
except for the fact that the one good thing is,

00:24:53.317 --> 00:24:57.557
apparently they've learned that the toxin in this type could kill cancer,

00:24:58.967 --> 00:25:03.937
so they are researching that they aren't the other thing just really it's quite 

00:25:03.937 --> 00:25:06.107
interesting the way that they're trying,

00:25:06.117 --> 00:25:08.937
they're thinking about stopping them is well,

00:25:09.067 --> 00:25:13.807
at least to stop them raiding our native wildlife is to just give very small toads to the night of 

00:25:13.807 --> 00:25:16.157
wildlife that makes them seek but doesn't kill them,

00:25:16.447 --> 00:25:18.157
so that then they won't go near the bigger ones.

00:25:18.857 --> 00:25:23.677
But my particular favorite thing about that is so they've now done what they've done is they've turned them into 

00:25:23.677 --> 00:25:24.177
sausages,

00:25:25.067 --> 00:25:27.807
i toid sausages there,

00:25:27.807 --> 00:25:29.877
hopefully our native four,

00:25:29.877 --> 00:25:34.317
noble eight and therefore not eat the big tides the bit that i don't understand,

00:25:34.317 --> 00:25:39.297
i have to talk to someone about this is how a sausage looks like a like surely it's not what it looks like 

00:25:39.357 --> 00:25:44.257
but anyway it's maybe there's more to it than that all right now let's get 

00:25:44.257 --> 00:25:49.107
back into the platform what i want you to do now is let i've just given you some facts 

00:25:49.257 --> 00:25:53.407
you've got you know it's have a quick look back to your 

00:25:54.037 --> 00:25:58.747
connection and see how much of it you go correct is there anything you'd 

00:25:58.747 --> 00:26:03.617
change and remember you can just click on that take it back inside if you need to but you don't you don't you know 

00:26:03.617 --> 00:26:07.487
it's right there come on have a look back you just didn't get anything right did you know anything?

00:26:07.487 --> 00:26:09.419
Some of you the new backhand todd's already 

00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:15.079
sugar related.

00:26:15.079 --> 00:26:15.599
Very good.

00:26:34.999 --> 00:26:35.599
All right,

00:26:35.609 --> 00:26:36.829
thank you as i said,

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:38.119
no exam,

00:26:38.119 --> 00:26:42.849
no sheep stations based on the knowledge of their cane toads but again it's about god what's important about 

00:26:42.849 --> 00:26:46.719
going back to your connection was a about you know,

00:26:46.719 --> 00:26:51.489
we're trying to make those neural pathway so that actually you've got the correct facts if there was anything in there that you got 

00:26:51.489 --> 00:26:56.359
wrong it's a really important now that you make that link and get rid of the pig that was wrong so that we that we stick with the 

00:26:56.359 --> 00:26:58.699
bit that was right okay,

00:26:59.629 --> 00:27:04.489
so we've been looking at the nights the interesting question that there's one of the 

00:27:04.489 --> 00:27:09.189
points and you need to make so the notes are available on lee to the student that's riding them,

00:27:10.039 --> 00:27:12.279
i can see how many wrote every night,

00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:12.819
how many roads,

00:27:12.819 --> 00:27:13.509
how many nights,

00:27:13.509 --> 00:27:14.069
he wrote,

00:27:15.359 --> 00:27:16.889
i'll know if you wrote a lot or a little,

00:27:16.889 --> 00:27:21.219
i'll be undergoing look att the analytics after this and see who participated in my lovely session that counter 

00:27:22.119 --> 00:27:25.979
and sit next to you tomorrow if it's not that,

00:27:26.809 --> 00:27:27.269
um,

00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:29.509
but i can see who wrote notes and then and,

00:27:29.609 --> 00:27:29.819
you know,

00:27:29.819 --> 00:27:30.019
that's,

00:27:30.019 --> 00:27:34.939
an important thing about studying is whether or not you can take notes now 

00:27:34.949 --> 00:27:37.949
doesn't mean students out taking notes just cause you don't see them in the platform.

00:27:37.949 --> 00:27:38.259
Of course,

00:27:38.259 --> 00:27:42.679
they might choose to take their night in some other form of the q and a,

00:27:42.679 --> 00:27:43.349
however,

00:27:43.509 --> 00:27:44.709
where i asked those questions,

00:27:44.709 --> 00:27:45.579
ask youto thumbs up,

00:27:45.589 --> 00:27:47.669
you already know that you could all see it,

00:27:48.039 --> 00:27:49.679
so if you're involved in the q and a,

00:27:50.099 --> 00:27:53.519
then everybody sees it all right to use the cue and i again,

00:27:53.519 --> 00:27:54.039
briefly,

00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:59.479
what i want you to do now is i want you to pretend that we've got com coming in the conservation and land management 

00:27:59.489 --> 00:27:59.999
authority.

00:28:00.899 --> 00:28:03.689
I'm going to give you just a very short time to think on your own,

00:28:04.359 --> 00:28:05.779
you don't need to write anything down yet,

00:28:06.329 --> 00:28:11.316
but i'd like you to do is think of one possible solution and or question that you would ask 

00:28:11.316 --> 00:28:14.476
of cam to suit on your own about cane toads,

00:28:14.476 --> 00:28:14.646
right?

00:28:14.646 --> 00:28:19.406
We're trying to solve this problem they have gotten all over australia the getting bigger they're getting 

00:28:19.406 --> 00:28:20.576
stronger they're getting better.

00:28:20.686 --> 00:28:21.916
What could we do?

00:28:22.046 --> 00:28:26.476
What would you ask out calm people to help solve the problem or do you have a 

00:28:26.476 --> 00:28:27.056
solution?

00:28:27.606 --> 00:28:28.896
Just needs to be a quick,

00:28:29.316 --> 00:28:31.306
very quick thing just do it on your own self.

00:28:53.576 --> 00:28:53.936
Okay?

00:28:53.946 --> 00:28:54.576
That's long enough.

00:28:54.586 --> 00:28:55.226
Thank you.

00:28:55.766 --> 00:29:00.326
What i want to do now is i want you to we could do this in a group of 

00:29:00.336 --> 00:29:04.966
two but i think let's make it easier and do it in a three if you can 

00:29:06.096 --> 00:29:10.986
two or three what i want you to do now they want you to talk with your colleagues and i want you to agree 

00:29:11.196 --> 00:29:15.826
on that one statement or question because i'm going to get you to put him in the platform but i don't 

00:29:15.826 --> 00:29:20.666
want a whole room full of the same thing so what i want you to do see if you can agree on 

00:29:20.666 --> 00:29:25.536
one one statement question you would ask how do it with your neighbors so there's like three of you 

00:29:25.546 --> 00:29:29.086
who are making one decision you can 

00:29:51.466 --> 00:30:05.126
wait 

00:30:06.846 --> 00:30:10.346
okay remember it's not sheep station so to keep everyone happy just agree 

00:30:14.874 --> 00:30:19.704
what i would like you to do now if we can do it and that's the room is that you're not full 

00:30:19.704 --> 00:30:20.004
enough,

00:30:20.014 --> 00:30:21.004
this might be a bit tricky,

00:30:21.004 --> 00:30:23.494
but you just gotta play the game with me you've played really well so far,

00:30:23.494 --> 00:30:28.374
so keep playing is what i want you to do now is i want you to turn your three around and join another 

00:30:28.374 --> 00:30:31.414
three so that you become a six so what we're doing here,

00:30:31.414 --> 00:30:36.354
this is a process called sybil and it's really good if you need to make a decision or you want to reduce 

00:30:36.354 --> 00:30:36.684
something,

00:30:36.684 --> 00:30:39.674
you start with two you moved before you knew you could go to aid or sixteen,

00:30:39.674 --> 00:30:41.764
and by then i'd stop because nobody agrees,

00:30:42.504 --> 00:30:44.494
but see if you could just come up with the one for my place 

00:30:56.674 --> 00:31:04.314
way 

00:31:04.744 --> 00:31:05.224
move it,

00:31:34.874 --> 00:31:37.504
i thank you very much.

00:31:42.134 --> 00:31:46.974
I have you managed to a great here's what i'd like you did it 

00:31:46.974 --> 00:31:51.274
now i want a copy of those solutions,

00:31:52.064 --> 00:31:52.514
right?

00:31:53.034 --> 00:31:57.844
But i know that they're you've worked now in groups of about six let's say so i don't want all 

00:31:57.844 --> 00:31:58.864
six of you to write it,

00:31:58.874 --> 00:32:03.784
so i'm gonna ask just one of you to put the question in as 

00:32:03.784 --> 00:32:07.134
in fact a new question or a statement if it was a statement,

00:32:07.134 --> 00:32:08.114
whatever your solution is,

00:32:08.344 --> 00:32:13.139
but the person that's going to write it is the person in your group your birthday's closest to today 

00:32:13.629 --> 00:32:18.549
and i don't mean you know this is not about point finger the youngest is the day 

00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:20.139
in the month courses today 

00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:34.369
then what's today ten doesn't matter that's four days away ten days away 

00:32:35.479 --> 00:32:40.469
but you write you write it in thank you person you're 

00:32:40.469 --> 00:32:45.359
not still talking about his birthday's closest name but in 

00:33:04.719 --> 00:33:05.459
a 

00:33:11.359 --> 00:33:15.059
way 

00:33:17.189 --> 00:33:22.079
all righty thank you very much hopefully the youngest person if they're young guys 

00:33:22.159 --> 00:33:27.109
but now now i'm saying it sorry person whose birthday's closest today um is writing that 

00:33:27.109 --> 00:33:32.109
and if they haven't already now there was something that i should have done that i didn't there but 

00:33:32.119 --> 00:33:36.029
it's always a good learning opportunity when you do that 

00:33:36.699 --> 00:33:41.519
because there's a q and a that could be used by everyone and there's all sorts of different questions in there 

00:33:42.139 --> 00:33:46.459
and i asked you to do a specific activity how am i going to tell your questions from everybody?

00:33:46.459 --> 00:33:51.019
Else's what i should have asked you to do the person that's writing it in his mighty hashtag 

00:33:51.219 --> 00:33:56.029
for me so some symbol that tells me this is linked to this activity right?

00:33:56.289 --> 00:34:01.269
Because we've all got access to it and i want you to look at them so as we get them typed it sterile 

00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:06.119
only young use something like that that's actually quite interesting they 

00:34:06.129 --> 00:34:10.439
did try all sorts of kind of like her beside him that's not what i 

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:15.261
thank you um 

00:34:15.271 --> 00:34:18.401
pesticides and actually what happened is the tides just kind of 

00:34:21.161 --> 00:34:21.791
exactly 

00:34:27.151 --> 00:34:31.901
so take a look down now at u of the rest of the group's answers and what they 

00:34:31.901 --> 00:34:36.631
thought and this is your opportunity again you can thumbs up if you want to if you see one that you think is particularly 

00:34:36.631 --> 00:34:39.871
great because these are the ones that will take to camp 

00:35:11.491 --> 00:35:23.751
wait,

00:35:25.571 --> 00:35:28.521
wait,

00:35:29.321 --> 00:35:33.951
wait all right some 

00:35:33.951 --> 00:35:38.881
grace some great questions and examples i like the two is beer and 

00:35:38.881 --> 00:35:39.701
one but however,

00:35:39.701 --> 00:35:40.801
as i've responded to,

00:35:40.801 --> 00:35:45.771
you know it wouldn't work and it's actually illegal it is illegal in australia to 

00:35:45.771 --> 00:35:46.811
harm the cane toads,

00:35:46.851 --> 00:35:51.721
although many people have thought it would be a great practice and apparently i think there was also a politician that 

00:35:51.731 --> 00:35:56.661
first suggested they use a cricket bat and a golf club it's no longer a politician surprise,

00:35:56.991 --> 00:35:57.421
surprise,

00:35:57.431 --> 00:36:02.151
surprise what's the 

00:36:02.151 --> 00:36:07.061
reasoning for not being allowed to do it because they are living creatures and it's inhumane 

00:36:09.521 --> 00:36:11.281
sorry you've got me distracted now look,

00:36:11.281 --> 00:36:15.896
um alone beautiful,

00:36:15.906 --> 00:36:17.396
thank you very much for doing that.

00:36:17.816 --> 00:36:18.206
All right,

00:36:22.716 --> 00:36:25.056
you can't post anonymously in the either,

00:36:31.286 --> 00:36:35.666
so there have been a couple of questions about the app i'm gonna answer them afterwards sorry,

00:36:35.676 --> 00:36:38.186
but yes,

00:36:38.186 --> 00:36:38.656
of course,

00:36:39.106 --> 00:36:39.376
yeah,

00:36:39.466 --> 00:36:44.136
and i'll make sure that i answer them so you can see see what happens later you can go in and have a look i'll answer 

00:36:44.136 --> 00:36:49.006
everybody's questions so we don't take up time now i'm talking about the platform in that 

00:36:49.006 --> 00:36:50.246
way okay,

00:36:51.336 --> 00:36:56.166
so i want to show you another tool that i i particularly like this is 

00:36:56.166 --> 00:36:59.506
another so what we were doing there um 

00:37:00.896 --> 00:37:04.886
obviously looking at questions i want to turn now to 

00:37:06.786 --> 00:37:11.766
looking at confused flag so the next slide just flicked them through few cells four or 

00:37:11.766 --> 00:37:16.666
five slides here you have a confused flag on your screen this little about 

00:37:16.666 --> 00:37:21.576
baby up here this is where you get to let me know if you confused so what i want you to do 

00:37:21.576 --> 00:37:25.996
is just as we click through these aerial slide that i've chosen 

00:37:26.936 --> 00:37:31.736
based on the information that i have told you and if you look at any of these new girl hang 

00:37:31.736 --> 00:37:36.706
on that doesn't make sense based on what we've learned or talked about today then you just get to 

00:37:37.616 --> 00:37:38.756
check on the confused like 

00:37:47.506 --> 00:37:52.396
we've got people here they can't decide if they confused enough look for five six seven eight right 

00:37:52.406 --> 00:37:54.446
you can turn it on and off isn't that great?

00:37:54.646 --> 00:37:59.586
So this is a cane tried actually it's it is i don't blame you if you're a bit confused that you're trying to eat a 

00:37:59.586 --> 00:38:04.376
bet that's a bad that's coming out of it it doesn't really matter then and i said yes 

00:38:06.136 --> 00:38:10.206
but i love this is one of my favorite tools this confused tell that 

00:38:11.146 --> 00:38:13.409
tell the instructor when you confused.

00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.599
Now,

00:38:14.599 --> 00:38:19.209
this does take a bit of classroom management if you going to use it being that and at the beginning of the 

00:38:19.209 --> 00:38:19.739
semester,

00:38:19.739 --> 00:38:19.989
right?

00:38:19.989 --> 00:38:24.859
So just the same way you do with your assignments and who comes to class on time and all those kinds of things 

00:38:24.939 --> 00:38:27.809
i would need to set up if i'm gonna use this confused,

00:38:27.809 --> 00:38:29.629
like you need to know how is gonna operate it.

00:38:29.639 --> 00:38:30.649
So for example,

00:38:30.819 --> 00:38:32.689
if there are less than five people confused,

00:38:32.689 --> 00:38:35.039
i'm not going to stop the lecture and talk about it.

00:38:35.209 --> 00:38:40.209
I need youto to send me an email and let me know or come and see me in office hours so we can 

00:38:40.209 --> 00:38:45.149
talk about it because if i stop every time someone says they're confused and i've got a student that's confused every 

00:38:45.149 --> 00:38:46.039
time i open my mouth,

00:38:46.879 --> 00:38:47.789
i'm not going to get anywhere,

00:38:47.789 --> 00:38:50.009
but you got to come up with those kinds of policies,

00:38:50.009 --> 00:38:51.029
so but,

00:38:51.039 --> 00:38:51.339
you know,

00:38:51.339 --> 00:38:52.399
fourteen students,

00:38:52.419 --> 00:38:52.749
ok?

00:38:52.759 --> 00:38:53.879
Because there's a bet.

00:38:54.119 --> 00:38:55.489
So i've answered that for you now,

00:38:55.489 --> 00:38:55.759
right?

00:38:55.839 --> 00:39:00.499
Remember what we were talking about before with the knowledge i don't want you going away with incorrect 

00:39:00.499 --> 00:39:05.369
information okay if i'm going to get you to predict if i'm going to get you to kind of 

00:39:05.379 --> 00:39:10.029
think outside the box in this way what i need to do is correct you immediately if you're wrong 

00:39:10.379 --> 00:39:14.559
or you sack creating those neural pathways with the wrong information 

00:39:22.909 --> 00:39:26.549
but they can't accept that too so i just came towards in the straight you've got on your screen 

00:39:31.139 --> 00:39:36.089
few people confuse see me about that later we just talked about the migration how 

00:39:36.089 --> 00:39:40.929
they were taking over the world but that one i got yes that's actually greentree 

00:39:40.929 --> 00:39:42.419
fork it's not a toy a little 

00:39:47.639 --> 00:39:52.289
yeah the travel and you know what they've discovered you don't like 

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:57.109
dense college so what they actually do is they do use a lot of their roads and pathways because it's not 

00:39:57.119 --> 00:40:01.279
quick um and i do yeah they gathered together quickly 

00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:09.249
you can't possibly stop yourself can you thie cows going in that direction 

00:40:11.869 --> 00:40:14.803
um and the last okay,

00:40:16.813 --> 00:40:17.103
right?

00:40:17.283 --> 00:40:21.803
I just did that around picked pictures of kind toys but the purpose what i wanted to show you uh 

00:40:22.013 --> 00:40:27.013
think about this in the class high end of semester you've just done all of 

00:40:27.013 --> 00:40:31.763
this teaching this so much amazing content that you know we think putting into s students heads 

00:40:32.083 --> 00:40:36.423
on we're about strike start getting it out with an exam and i want to do some revision 

00:40:37.833 --> 00:40:42.533
you can help me decide which is the best things to revise if i give you a siri's of 

00:40:42.533 --> 00:40:46.183
slides and ask you to put where you're confused on different concepts and topics,

00:40:46.473 --> 00:40:51.363
then i know that these concepts of all being understood and everyone's doing 

00:40:51.363 --> 00:40:56.133
really well but the majority of my class totally missed everything i talked about in week six 

00:40:56.433 --> 00:41:01.153
and a lot of people have asked me to review stuff i didn't wee k so what you're actually doing is you're 

00:41:01.163 --> 00:41:05.863
giving me some way to go when i'm doing review and revision or 

00:41:06.103 --> 00:41:10.953
if it was just happened in a class what i can do now offices i can go away and i could 

00:41:10.953 --> 00:41:15.593
maybe create a little mini tutorial give me about five minutes tutorial that i could then 

00:41:15.593 --> 00:41:16.473
post up and say,

00:41:16.623 --> 00:41:17.023
hey,

00:41:17.023 --> 00:41:22.003
i know i confused some of you with the cane toads they didn't talk about that um here's the 

00:41:22.003 --> 00:41:24.333
answer yeah,

00:41:32.303 --> 00:41:33.093
one more for you 

00:41:37.133 --> 00:41:40.243
this is an image quiz if you haven't seen one before well,

00:41:40.243 --> 00:41:44.853
you do what i all i need you to do is just put a dot where you think the answer is 

00:41:49.823 --> 00:41:53.273
where would you not expect to see cane toads based on everything we talked about 

00:42:00.973 --> 00:42:05.753
perry might even talk about these image quiz is a little bit later in his position and he's got some beautiful ones that i 

00:42:05.763 --> 00:42:08.073
usually used when i'm doing training 

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:19.310
again i know there were a few people that had signed on to come today we weren't 

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:24.170
necessarily using the platform just a quick this is great right 

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:28.670
in all of these activities we've done i've got really great 

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:33.330
um view of whose how many students about dissipating 

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:36.230
what's going on are people are you engaged?

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:40.270
Are you actually purchased fighting in the in the activities that i'm giving you 

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:46.060
so this is what i get to stop it if i want to and say no more but i'm happy for you to keep going 

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:50.980
but i get to show the results 

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:03.030
i can't swim oh do that sorry 

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:09.400
accounts from that distance that's margaret his manager 

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:14.850
you know they're not in tasmania i feel there are more northern yes they 

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:19.660
haven't moved down there yet all right so i get to see now what your thinking 

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:24.400
is right what you know how much did you learn about this little lesson and 

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:29.270
again i mean i'm making it take long because i'm explaining it to you but if we had a class every 

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:34.050
week and i just gave you this what does it take me a couple of minutes done and i get to move 

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:34.290
on 

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:47.080
last one i promise and then we'll we'll just finish up the last few 

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.330
things right?

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:52.820
What do you know about cane toads as a pissed off you go you've got one minute ride as much as you can 

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:21.310
nice i spied quickly they break quickly it's illegal to kill them on the door so cute 

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:41.020
nice someone likes them they're misunderstood 

00:44:57.110 --> 00:45:00.490
thank you alright,

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:06.300
i'll stop you there thank you for that that's really awesome and again no exam on this snow ship 

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:11.120
stations at stake so we're good to go so the last two 

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.880
activities that we did where i've got you to use the image quiz and i got you to write this one minute saying 

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:17.680
examples of retrieval,

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:18.270
right?

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:22.840
So we spend a lot of time making sure that we get information into students 

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:26.740
heads we actually have to give them opportunities to practice getting it out.

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.600
All right,

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:28.380
you know,

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.460
i was on the windows on the plane coming over i was watching peter rabbit 

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:38.550
pt thank you very much and i don't know if you've seen it,

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:43.330
but it's obviously it's humans but it's also the animated rabbits and the the actor that 

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:46.840
played the animated peter rabbit i knew his voice.

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:48.600
I knew his voice.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.210
I knew his voice,

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:51.050
but i could not figure it out.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:51.880
And i said,

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:52.420
who is it?

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:56.990
And then all of a sudden i i know it's a comedian and i got about halfway through the movie and i 

00:45:56.990 --> 00:46:01.580
went is james they sure didn't 

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:06.910
forget i i know it so well it's james corden right so then i was very places 

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:11.830
myself obviously but here's what would have happened if the woman next to me had gone all that's james 

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:13.610
cordon i would've said oh yeah,

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:18.430
i know all right one of the worst things that students do when they are 

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:23.300
revising is to re read their books right there get the textbook and they 

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:28.260
read it and i learned things and then when they're going to do there study they re read it again and i 

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:32.330
read it again and guess what happens because they read it before they go yeah,

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:32.750
i know that,

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:38.550
but i'm one of the things that something like this which is a retrieval practice does is it insist that 

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:42.930
they bring it forward and do they actually know it so you've got to get him to do it without notes 

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:48.040
you just got to pull the information forward that's the kind of thing that we need to practice because 

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:53.040
otherwise we think we know stuff on don't necessarily know it and 

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:54.160
you know it happens in daylight.

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:58.860
I don't know if you've got friends like i've got i've got friends who are very good at monte pathan,

00:46:59.370 --> 00:46:59.730
right?

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:04.360
They can tell you every line from the movie there's a situation where they've got a line for it 

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:07.350
and i used to be like how do they do it?

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:12.450
And i realized that actually what they do is retrieval practice but i'm not suggesting that they sit at home 

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:17.200
practicing the lines of monty python but they'll hear a line in a movie and very 

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:22.170
quickly afterwards they'll use it and then they'll use it again and then there might get to someone else is using it 

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:27.130
and they both use those lines and so they become very good at was signing lines from 

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:31.830
movies and we've got to get off students to do that but obviously with the facts off the area that we 

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:36.810
teach not with monty python again it's only gonna take you a few minutes at 

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:41.570
the beginning or end of the class to get students to retrieve information right betrayed 

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:46.510
everything i've taught you or at the beginning of the next class remember we talked about cane toads i'm going to 

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:51.270
give you a minute to write everything down that you can remember about kind words any of these 

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:55.420
examples beautiful work thank you still watch 

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:03.570
all right couple of things that we just want to talk about as we wrap up they as i said at 

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:08.280
the beginning these kinds of teaching skills and strategies have been around for a long 

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:13.070
time we've known since the fifties about a lot of this stuff right all the active mooning the blooms 

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:17.768
taxonomy different higher and lower level thinking meta cognition it's 

00:48:17.778 --> 00:48:22.408
olden around but we haven't had tools like this that make it quick and easy for us to use in the 

00:48:22.408 --> 00:48:27.188
classroom and i've written chains laying up there because i knew all about connecting in 

00:48:27.188 --> 00:48:32.078
particular retrieval and there are many more but what i feel like i really like about what 

00:48:32.078 --> 00:48:36.898
he did when i saw him i shall listen to him on a podcast was he gave it the 

00:48:36.898 --> 00:48:41.858
title small teaching and i think that makes a far less threatening for us when we're 

00:48:41.858 --> 00:48:46.728
thinking about it in that way it's just something small that i do in my class that takes me 

00:48:46.728 --> 00:48:51.548
five minutes at the beginning the middle or an end of the class but i'm really helping my students 

00:48:51.928 --> 00:48:54.968
to get the kind of knowledge and content that they're going to need to the exam 

00:48:58.938 --> 00:49:03.778
so they're the three that we did as i said there's plenty more um things that you know 

00:49:08.488 --> 00:49:10.948
i am going to talk about this is very bro briefly 

00:49:13.438 --> 00:49:18.408
because gonna switch switch hats a bit away from kanto andi actually 

00:49:18.408 --> 00:49:23.218
the platform and what i just wanted to spend a couple of minutes cause i know there are a number of you in this room who 

00:49:23.218 --> 00:49:28.108
said that you actually worked with economic structure training them on the platform here's some of the things 

00:49:28.338 --> 00:49:32.568
that i think attentions that we have to deal with when we're implementing 

00:49:32.838 --> 00:49:37.428
something like an echo three sixty or any kind of program that's noon we have to 

00:49:37.798 --> 00:49:42.318
teach people about the attentions that doesn't mean it's a negative thing i just 

00:49:42.798 --> 00:49:47.778
it's just what they are training first versus professional development right now this 

00:49:47.778 --> 00:49:52.088
is one that i live with a ll the time because the university asked me to come in and go,

00:49:52.088 --> 00:49:56.998
can you come in and train our stuff absolutely love to one of my favorite things to do i go 

00:49:56.998 --> 00:50:01.818
in and actually all i can do is training because i've got four hours to 

00:50:01.818 --> 00:50:06.528
get everything in and what actually usually ends up happening is people are wonderful,

00:50:06.528 --> 00:50:11.528
but cognitive overload starts to sit in and one day i'll do a whole beach 

00:50:11.528 --> 00:50:13.278
feel on cognitive overload as well.

00:50:13.608 --> 00:50:17.442
One of things you might notice is that i use mostly images today 

00:50:18.452 --> 00:50:23.412
not screeds of text on slides because if i'm telling you the facts and you're raiding the 

00:50:23.412 --> 00:50:27.982
facts you're brian is trying to cope with too many things at once and you miss things 

00:50:28.372 --> 00:50:33.352
but i want the time training business professional development so if you are actually 

00:50:33.362 --> 00:50:37.872
in a role where you are going to be really response double for the implementation and your 

00:50:37.882 --> 00:50:42.812
academics using echo think about how you can make it true professional development 

00:50:42.812 --> 00:50:44.142
as opposed to training,

00:50:44.582 --> 00:50:49.432
training here's the button that you press here's what you do professional development 

00:50:49.652 --> 00:50:54.542
what is it that you want to maybe change or deepen about your teaching and happen this platform help you 

00:50:54.552 --> 00:50:58.792
do it and then it needs to be ongoing so if 

00:50:58.802 --> 00:51:03.702
way we're actually working in the same university and i might have done this session about the small teaching,

00:51:04.532 --> 00:51:09.402
i probably send you'il an ad ical or a note or something about small teaching in a 

00:51:09.402 --> 00:51:14.282
couple of weeks and then maybe i'd link you to a video because professional name 

00:51:14.742 --> 00:51:19.682
development it's big ongoing in sustained so i just want to put that in there for you to think 

00:51:19.682 --> 00:51:24.502
about and also we're not all the same could you in fact train 

00:51:24.502 --> 00:51:26.232
people based on their teaching style?

00:51:27.362 --> 00:51:31.472
How do you use echo three sixty if ur inquiry diced 

00:51:32.292 --> 00:51:37.282
how might use echo three sixty if you flip your classroom as opposed to everybody come in 

00:51:37.282 --> 00:51:42.102
and let's all learned the same thing even though i'm i lecture seven hundred students 

00:51:42.232 --> 00:51:47.132
and the person sitting next to me actually does workshops not that you can't get great content,

00:51:47.132 --> 00:51:51.532
but i just kinda wanted to throw it out there because you work in the university you have this up 

00:51:52.032 --> 00:51:56.662
wonderful opportunity to really help to use this platform to 

00:51:56.672 --> 00:52:01.632
start to make the types of changes in teaching that we talked about before everybody knows we should have 

00:52:01.632 --> 00:52:02.332
been doing them,

00:52:02.582 --> 00:52:07.582
but it was really hard what the platform does is it takes that hardness away makes it 

00:52:07.582 --> 00:52:11.632
much more simple we talked a little bit of a 

00:52:12.252 --> 00:52:17.007
technology person teaching that's very much linked against that professional development you get 

00:52:17.017 --> 00:52:21.747
really quickly always loaded if you tryingto worry that which of the buttons that i press how do i 

00:52:21.747 --> 00:52:22.837
create a class?

00:52:23.407 --> 00:52:25.327
How did how did you make that image quiz?

00:52:25.757 --> 00:52:28.527
Where's what i want you to be thinking about is how you gonna teach with the image 

00:52:31.027 --> 00:52:32.917
so there's that tension if i'm trying,

00:52:32.917 --> 00:52:37.857
i'm doing a workshop with your training you're my training you on how to use the technology training on how to 

00:52:37.857 --> 00:52:41.487
teach with the technology linking it back to professional development.

00:52:41.487 --> 00:52:42.187
Can you do both?

00:52:42.187 --> 00:52:42.297
Um,

00:52:42.297 --> 00:52:43.467
how can you make that work?

00:52:45.327 --> 00:52:46.867
Um and then lastly,

00:52:46.967 --> 00:52:49.157
this is just one of my own personal little messages.

00:52:50.427 --> 00:52:55.167
We hear a lot about teacher centered versus student centered.

00:52:55.177 --> 00:53:00.027
I hear a lot where wherever i go onda natural fact i was just 

00:53:00.047 --> 00:53:04.937
did cem cem work in the university with a high level panel and one of the 

00:53:04.937 --> 00:53:05.267
very,

00:53:05.267 --> 00:53:09.447
very senior academics there scratch guy but he was a big imagine lee 

00:53:09.837 --> 00:53:13.727
sometimes can happen and at the end he stood up to give his verdict and i thought,

00:53:13.727 --> 00:53:13.797
oh,

00:53:13.797 --> 00:53:14.877
here we go and he said,

00:53:14.877 --> 00:53:15.347
you know what?

00:53:16.077 --> 00:53:20.837
I like that confusion flag i can use that confusion flag but i tell you now i am teacher 

00:53:20.837 --> 00:53:25.517
centered because it's about me and i stand and i lecture and i gotta listen to me but i like that 

00:53:25.517 --> 00:53:28.757
confusion flag because the students can let me know when i'm off track,

00:53:30.047 --> 00:53:33.927
they can let me know what i have to repeat something that brilliant.

00:53:34.177 --> 00:53:34.987
What more could we ask?

00:53:35.927 --> 00:53:37.227
Because what he's actually doing?

00:53:37.227 --> 00:53:42.117
He says he's teacher's scented but he's also is actually verging mohr to learning 

00:53:42.117 --> 00:53:46.027
center when we asked student centered,

00:53:46.027 --> 00:53:50.917
sometimes we miss the learning bit because the students are so hands on and it's 

00:53:50.917 --> 00:53:51.997
all about the students,

00:53:52.177 --> 00:53:53.707
and they might lead to complain and go,

00:53:53.707 --> 00:53:55.457
but you really don't another learned anything,

00:53:56.127 --> 00:53:58.897
and i really need needed to hear what you had to say,

00:53:59.457 --> 00:54:01.537
but if i focus on learning center,

00:54:01.837 --> 00:54:03.977
then i'm doing the right thing for the right opportunity.

00:54:04.327 --> 00:54:09.247
So one day i'm lecturing it's about mei you're listening to me because i've got some really great stories and some really 

00:54:09.247 --> 00:54:10.147
good things to tell you,

00:54:10.147 --> 00:54:14.907
and you need to know them and another day i've actually set it up more into a 

00:54:14.917 --> 00:54:18.217
much more active interactive kind of process.

00:54:18.557 --> 00:54:18.807
Yeah,

00:54:20.847 --> 00:54:21.177
all right,

00:54:21.957 --> 00:54:25.277
i think there's a couple more slides bail them,

00:54:25.277 --> 00:54:28.387
we'll talk about that mallet on thank you very much.

00:54:28.397 --> 00:54:32.997
I really appreciate you getting into cane toads with mei it's been awesome 

00:54:33.337 --> 00:54:33.927
thank you,

00:54:38.527 --> 00:54:43.227
wei have a bright now just go straight on 

00:54:43.567 --> 00:54:43.837
