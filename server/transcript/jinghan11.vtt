pre conference workshops i've got the the warm up act on its really just to kind of

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.270
get you into the system and to tell you a little bit about what we're gonna be doing this

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.870

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.430
First of all,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.420
just say delighted that so many people have come today this is a bit of an experiment for

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.210
us and a departure from what we've typically done for the last ten years or more

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.430
in introducing a pre conference workshop just to try and shake things up a little bit get

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.350
you to be doing things in the platform and spending more time with

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.190
each other so that hopefully when we start the main conference day tomorrow you're all

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.870
warmed up,

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.190
you know each other a little bit more on dh you hit the ground running

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.200
so there's going to be more people attending tomorrow's wealth.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.270
This is kind of a subset of all the registrations,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.780
but it's a great great turnouts already.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.330

00:03:23.348 --> 00:03:28.128
access in this room for people who are university members

00:03:28.128 --> 00:03:32.858
across the uk there's also the cloud so if you're not from the u k

00:03:33.148 --> 00:03:38.148
i'm not from hate she proper something that many people here in the room today that would apply to

00:03:38.158 --> 00:03:42.938
but you can logging used in the cloud in terms of the space that we've

00:03:42.948 --> 00:03:43.548
got.

00:03:43.558 --> 00:03:48.478
You'll notice that when else and ask the question we too have microphones that you can just

press the button and speak and obviously that would be recorded as we're recording each of these sessions

00:03:54.918 --> 00:03:59.428
the other points as well to notice that we have power available for each of the

00:03:59.428 --> 00:04:04.272

on dh please just kind of move around go to the toilets do whatever you want to whenever you need

00:04:14.222 --> 00:04:19.182
to they're just sort of round the back of here back through to the reception area that we

00:04:19.402 --> 00:04:23.562
all came through on just i think so i decide i think of the reception

00:04:26.282 --> 00:04:31.062
any other point is there are no plant fire alarms i

00:04:31.422 --> 00:04:36.362
