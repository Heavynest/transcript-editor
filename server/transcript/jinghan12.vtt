WEBVTT

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.750
Good afternoon i'm Jinghan

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.940
andi i'm from the university of sheffield on dh for this next session

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.770
we going tio have a opportunity to

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.440
share experiences off moving to on

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.830
institutional wide opt out let you capture service

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.360
some may have already experienced this some may not some

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.010
maybe planning to but we're gonna work on the scenario

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.830
that's your institution will be doing so that they're beginning this

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.030
coming academic year on dh you'll be discussing

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.550
that with relation to specifically your institution on dh as a

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.970
discussion looking at identifying or trying to find cops off up to

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.790
five kind of common must dues toe having place

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.890
before that happens so my job had it your university of

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.980
sheffield is i work for the central idea department called kicks

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.430
on dh i used to be the learning and teaching systems

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.300
manager until this week when he got a new organizational chart which we've now got a

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.210
different title of the team on different fatal so i'm now

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.860
the academic systems on operations manager i'm

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.740
here with my colleagues from university chef laura on dh tom who

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.510
worked in the same team their job titles will figure out when we get

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.290
back to the office but their rows are to

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.290
support it's mainly the lecture capture system at

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.600
our university they also do with other services but

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.480
primarily that's what they deal with um let's just move

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.490
advanced that one let's just let's just move we'll do it that

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.650
way eso ya in today's that sure session we are going to just

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.740
breakouts roughly spends about forty five minutes

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.190
maximum on ben to come back here

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.200
would like us to actually to do is working groups

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.680
focus on on three areas one being technology

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.830
one being support and you're the one implementation

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.510
so tomorrow i will be giving a presentation with along with a

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.900
colleague from university of sheffield louise robson,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.390
to tell you our story about moving to andi opt out service so i don't

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.300
really wanna give too much away about how we did it and it's not about standing and saying this is what we did

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.030
andi,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.030
you just listen it's really more about having a discussion on then it's

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.390
being outed and share our experiences of where we felt that worked,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.100
but it didn't work well,

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.250
actually we haven't tried that and we would like to a swell,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.440
so what we'd like to do is to break into the sessions and i'd like to have a show of

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.360
hands those that would like to be in the group through it should discuss technology

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.130
okay,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.500
those that would like to do support you gotta choose what one out of three so you obviously you

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.070
choose which one so we're back to support

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.030
uh,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.620
okay,

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.130
yes,

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.020
it is a good man and an implementation so is anybody should

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.280
not put their hand up in once actually decides so would you like to see what would you like to do?

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.600
Technology?

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.220
Okay,

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.140
it kind of seemed like slightly even field,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.490
but i felt like the technology was less than the rest,

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.300
so what i'd like you to do is we're going to get up on dh

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.220
those actually working with technology will go with my colleague some on obviously

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.480
time if you don't choose that,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.690
sure,

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.590
the room over there sit sit down in tom's going to take some notes on then

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.260
of course the past will come back,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.770
and then tom will actually then present on behalf ofthe what you've actually come to a common

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.750
ground with a guard to actually your top fives with in terms of

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.500
technology with laura,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.670
can i just say,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.950
you see a show of hands again for support and then

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.070
implementation so lower if you want to stay here because i think

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.670
the actual support seems mohr and then i take the actual those of implementation to

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.620
another another group obviously microphones if you want teo using

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.870
here,

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.810
so then it could be catch it that's what we're actually wise on dh then

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.190
yes,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.050
just follow one of us,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.790
so for tom actually you're moving your tongue,

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.930
you know,

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.010
just to say hi,

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.660
excellent tom,

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.530
which introduced himself intellectual room on the floor if you want to do the same and

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.210
then those actually come to do in fermentation if you follow me i'm gonna go this way tom

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.230
you go that way and then we'll report back at quarter past any

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.940
questions so far super let's get

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.370
moving

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.030
way

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.030
too far

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.554
thank you everybody for uh freshly

00:06:05.084 --> 00:06:08.224
sharing your ideas your concerns

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:13.924
what would like to just do now is

00:06:15.344 --> 00:06:20.144
we're just going to office he just share what our top five musters were in these

00:06:20.144 --> 00:06:25.054
areas if what you actually

00:06:25.064 --> 00:06:29.604
if there's anything else that you picked up on that you feel like is essentially strongly or

00:06:30.794 --> 00:06:35.594
be really good for you to address police feel free teo youth ritual

00:06:36.144 --> 00:06:40.934
sure answer submissions on that into their number so we can have that look at that

00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:45.794
later what i do then is for those

00:06:45.794 --> 00:06:50.774
already in here laura if you want to just start off on passionate microphone if you won then just

00:06:51.094 --> 00:06:56.074
you've already got one could that hand house wouldn't go for it if you want to just actually then just tell us what you

00:06:56.254 --> 00:07:00.824
were five or roughly top five mustangs with regard to two hundred

00:07:01.584 --> 00:07:06.174
yeah so in this room we were talking about the support of staff and students when

00:07:06.174 --> 00:07:11.074
introducing an opt out policy we had quite a lot of shit to start off with we had

00:07:11.074 --> 00:07:15.924
over ten suggestions sort off with wilton down to five emerged something's in

00:07:15.924 --> 00:07:20.804
together to sort of create it to the top five thursday we said was mapping work flowing

00:07:20.804 --> 00:07:25.304
timetable in making sure the overlooks all meshed together to make sure it's a seamless as

00:07:25.304 --> 00:07:30.284
possible for the support slide things and the second thing that we said was calms and guidelines

00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:32.774
so making sure people knew exactly what was going to go on,

00:07:33.164 --> 00:07:34.174
why it was happening,

00:07:34.174 --> 00:07:35.154
how they work it,

00:07:35.444 --> 00:07:40.424
what guidelines are in place to make sure it fits into their teaching style and what they need to do

00:07:40.424 --> 00:07:44.214
to opt out if they did want to opt out training,

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:49.124
support sweeper online and face to face training and support of academics and students to make sure they know how

00:07:49.124 --> 00:07:50.054
the system works,

00:07:50.504 --> 00:07:51.954
why it works a certain way,

00:07:52.064 --> 00:07:53.794
how much they can actually work with it,

00:07:54.554 --> 00:07:59.364
how many different things that they could do without the different types of recordings that take place the interactive side of the

00:07:59.364 --> 00:08:04.261
system as well to encourage more people solve used the system work quit as well.

00:08:04.991 --> 00:08:09.811
And then we've put a recording copyright policy guidelines so making sure people knew

00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:14.721
why it was being recorded any sort of copyright guidelines that being placed gdp

00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:19.191
are came off a couple of times that i'm sorry and i was you policy

00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:21.531
guidelines on institution policy,

00:08:21.811 --> 00:08:23.671
making sure it's opened staff members,

00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:28.631
they know exactly what is being introduced why it should be used and then we put a policy review

00:08:28.631 --> 00:08:33.471
as well because a lot of policies are put into place and they sort of say i'll be reviewed in five years time but

00:08:33.481 --> 00:08:37.771
making sure that review actually takes place and it's updated accordingly in a few years time

00:08:38.361 --> 00:08:41.851
they were our top five for the support side of things super thank you,

00:08:43.561 --> 00:08:43.901
tom.

00:08:43.901 --> 00:08:45.111
Would you like to show yours?

00:08:45.731 --> 00:08:47.081
Sure excellent.

00:08:48.311 --> 00:08:53.161
So we were talking about the technology that we need in the rooms on

00:08:53.161 --> 00:08:57.001
dh what what what type of what or not in the rooms across the institution as well?

00:08:57.921 --> 00:09:01.921
One of the main ones that came up immediately was about the scheduling system

00:09:02.351 --> 00:09:06.421
to make sure that you had something in place that when you went to opt out,

00:09:06.801 --> 00:09:09.411
it would automatically be shed julian and then have another.

00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:14.231
But i have a easy way off if people did opt out how to actually remove

00:09:14.231 --> 00:09:16.581
them on dh stop those lectures from happening.

00:09:17.231 --> 00:09:22.071
One of the things we said was audio being a major part of it and making sure that there was some sort of

00:09:22.071 --> 00:09:27.051
hardware in the room that would capture audio regardless ofthe any other issues,

00:09:27.051 --> 00:09:30.411
so if electric didn't turn the microphone on or didn't turn a podium,

00:09:30.621 --> 00:09:34.111
we'll have a latte or a lapel mic that audio would still get captured.

00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:39.671
One of the main reasons was that if you've got electra talking through some slides you can always have

00:09:39.681 --> 00:09:42.671
the slide sent later day and have the audio

00:09:44.381 --> 00:09:49.341
way didn't have five but then in the end we had there have consistent a v

00:09:49.391 --> 00:09:54.281
in the rooms so or at least for the user experience so that

00:09:54.831 --> 00:09:59.321
when electorate comes into a room it looks the same the bit that they can see

00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:00.991
a ll is,

00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:01.551
you know,

00:10:01.551 --> 00:10:05.868
unique or different in different rooms it's all he's very standard on dh

00:10:06.598 --> 00:10:09.678
on dh that was mainly it yeah so that they can use it

00:10:11.398 --> 00:10:15.838
thank you what's interesting here in obviously both both groups what you actually

00:10:16.098 --> 00:10:21.078
identified was very similar in terms of what we were looking at in terms of the implementation

00:10:21.398 --> 00:10:23.328
on dso for implementation.

00:10:23.338 --> 00:10:28.028
One thing that we did talk about first and we're actually pretty much quiet at length

00:10:28.038 --> 00:10:32.868
was policy more in particular is a lot of things that we have in

00:10:32.868 --> 00:10:37.788
place now is the policy might be defined by the service it

00:10:37.788 --> 00:10:42.558
belongs to or a particular department but in order to actually to have an

00:10:42.568 --> 00:10:47.538
opt out institutional white that policy needs to be agreed created

00:10:47.838 --> 00:10:52.398
by a range of people but actually agreed at a high level academic

00:10:52.408 --> 00:10:57.138
wide so that's that then actually has more stick more weight and

00:10:57.138 --> 00:11:01.658
similar to yours whereby it then needs to be reviewed updated because things do

00:11:01.658 --> 00:11:06.268
change as well we also talked about

00:11:06.278 --> 00:11:07.518
the oh,

00:11:07.518 --> 00:11:12.118
what happens quite a lot of those institutions is people have to do

00:11:12.118 --> 00:11:15.178
something so people have to create a booking,

00:11:15.178 --> 00:11:16.038
create schedule,

00:11:16.048 --> 00:11:16.878
approve it,

00:11:17.098 --> 00:11:22.088
there's a lot of things that relies on people to do something which also

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:26.838
has a high risk of things not actually happening s o the least

00:11:26.838 --> 00:11:28.418
amount people have to do,

00:11:28.418 --> 00:11:33.148
the more systems can actually also schedule picking up things from booking

00:11:33.148 --> 00:11:36.518
system's the better it it would be

00:11:38.068 --> 00:11:43.038
also about managing expectations for people to

00:11:43.038 --> 00:11:43.848
what you understand,

00:11:43.848 --> 00:11:48.358
what they're going to expect being kind of truthful.

00:11:48.358 --> 00:11:48.778
That's,

00:11:48.788 --> 00:11:49.168
yes,

00:11:49.168 --> 00:11:51.168
this's actually aim's off this service,

00:11:51.168 --> 00:11:55.958
but these may not actually happens to just making sure people are clear about

00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:00.948
what you're you actually expected to actually have experience

00:12:00.948 --> 00:12:03.328
they're going to have in a room as well.

00:12:04.548 --> 00:12:05.308
And then lastly,

00:12:05.318 --> 00:12:10.008
was about the reliability on the quality ofthe audio

00:12:10.328 --> 00:12:15.318
on that that has actually been problem in other institutions where by

00:12:15.588 --> 00:12:20.078
it hasn't worked has let people down people lose trust they will lose faith

00:12:20.408 --> 00:12:25.378
on all this actually is about gaining people's trusts to make sure if you're going to use something that

00:12:25.378 --> 00:12:30.358
is actually people may be resistant to them or they can gain trust in

00:12:30.358 --> 00:12:34.638
your service on the technology on the policy is never your ship in place,

00:12:35.308 --> 00:12:40.298
the more likely they are to go with you just to

00:12:40.298 --> 00:12:43.448
follow on from that our university,

00:12:43.758 --> 00:12:48.738
when it was announced that we were going to an opt out there was a pretty i'm not going to name him who

00:12:48.738 --> 00:12:49.468
actually said,

00:12:49.478 --> 00:12:49.688
well,

00:12:49.688 --> 00:12:54.628
we're going to the as a faculty and we're going to actually opt out right from

00:12:54.628 --> 00:12:54.788
that,

00:12:54.788 --> 00:12:56.988
you're pretty level when they said that,

00:12:57.218 --> 00:13:02.188
and then close to the time they changed their mind on an all faculty do and energy of

00:13:02.188 --> 00:13:07.188
the ones with the highest recordings on the ones that had the most success the most that your restaurant's engaging,

00:13:07.198 --> 00:13:07.698
etcetera,

00:13:07.698 --> 00:13:08.248
etcetera,

00:13:08.628 --> 00:13:13.408
but but initial thought was we've been told to do this until we

00:13:13.408 --> 00:13:17.948
actually the immunization group was able to talk with them a little alley,

00:13:17.948 --> 00:13:19.208
that kind of their concerns,

00:13:19.208 --> 00:13:19.768
their fears,

00:13:19.768 --> 00:13:23.508
etcetera and communicate what they're going to expect

00:13:23.888 --> 00:13:24.868
exception.

00:13:26.058 --> 00:13:27.708
So that really,

00:13:27.938 --> 00:13:30.968
is it from us for that session?

00:13:31.518 --> 00:13:33.378
Thank you for participating.

00:13:33.388 --> 00:13:38.338
We do look forward to hearing more presentation at the conference and honestly talking with you further

00:13:38.758 --> 00:13:43.478
on what i'm going to do now is then just say a break because it was actually break

00:13:43.778 --> 00:13:45.948
these drinks,

00:13:45.948 --> 00:13:48.368
not super,

00:13:48.538 --> 00:13:49.528
so thank you Jinghan.

00:13:48.538 --> 00:13:49.528
